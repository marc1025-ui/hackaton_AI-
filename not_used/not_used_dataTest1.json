Those statistics are also relevant in the context of the European Semester, the EPSR action plan and the social economy action plan. They are also important for the Union to fulfil its tasks under the Treaties.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThe prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and the monitoring of adequate minimum wages pursuant to Directive (EU) 2022/2041 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) require accurate information on the evolution of hourly labour costs and wage levels, on the coverage of collective pay agreements and on the share of workers covered by a minimum wage across Member States.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nThe European Central Bank uses European labour market statistics on businesses, in the context of the single monetary policy, in particular those on the evolution of labour costs and wage growth. Therefore, accurate, timely, reliable and comparable Union statistics on the evolution of labour costs are necessary.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to extend the coverage of job vacancy statistics and the timeliness of the labour cost index as both indicators are listed among the Principal European Economic Indicators in the Commission Communication of 27 November 2002 on eurozone statistics ‘towards improved methodologies for eurozone statistics and indicators’, needed to monitor monetary and economic policies.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nIt is important for analytical purposes that an appropriate amount of back data is available to be able to assess labour cost indices over time.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to operationalise the definition of social enterprise, it is important to initiate feasibility and pilot studies with the aim of having specific data on social enterprises.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nA legal basis is necessary to regulate the transmission of annual data on gender pay gap for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals under the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, in particular, goal 5 on Gender Equality.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nThe implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, as described in Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), requires comparable data on wages received by men and women. In order to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women, Article 31 of the Directive (EU) 2023/970 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) requires Member States to provide the Commission with up-to-date gender pay gap data annually and in a timely manner. That obligation should be complemented by the appropriate necessary statistical frame for compiling and transmitting gender pay gap data, that should include the detailed topics, the periodicity of the data provision, the reference periods and the deadline for data transmission.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nThe concept of the gender pay gap is defined in Directive (EU) 2023/970. That definition should be adapted for the purpose of compiling and transmitting gender pay gap data under this Regulation. In particular, the term ‘employee’ is to cover workers in an employment relationship, including paid trainees and apprentices.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nTo complement the picture on pay differences, the Commission (Eurostat) should compile statistics regarding the total annual and monthly earnings, covering all their components, for male and female employees every 4 years, based on the structure of earnings data.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nThe gender pension gap is the relative difference between average gross pensions earned by women and men. This gap has its roots in different professional careers; those of women are characterised by lower pay, shorter and interrupted careers, and a lower volume of hours worked. As a result, women are at greater risk of poverty in later life. The data collected in the context of the labour market statistics on businesses regarding the structure of earnings, the gender pay gap and the structure of labour costs can also contribute to a better understanding of the gender pension gap in the Member States.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to simplify the existing legislation and foster harmonisation in scope, concepts, definitions and quality reporting, this Regulation should cover all European labour market statistics on businesses. Therefore, it is appropriate to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 (7) and Regulations (EC) No 450/2003 (8) and (EC) No 453/2008 (9) of the European Parliament and of the Council and replace them by this Regulation.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nIt is essential that statistics collected under this Regulation meet the quality criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). Statistical precision is an important measure of quality for data coming from samples. It is therefore necessary to specify precision targets that should be aimed at when sampling schemes are defined in Member States. In addition, for the purposes of quality reporting, the Commission (Eurostat) should include in its quality reporting guidance on how to further improve the quality of the statistics compiled under this Regulation. Member States might use innovative techniques to collect data, such as web scraping to collect data from websites. The data collected with those techniques should comply with the applicable quality requirements.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should take into account new needs that have emerged with the development of the Union and the euro area, provided that its provisions do not impose a significant additional cost or burden on respondents or national statistical authorities.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nTo limit the administrative and financial burden on enterprises, in particular on social enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises, the national statistical authorities should consider all available administrative, innovative and other sources, the main aim of which is not the provision of statistics, as a substitute for or a complement to statistical surveys, subject to the quality requirements for official statistics. The latest technological and digital developments can contribute to that objective.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nNational statistical authorities should take into account the principles of cost-effectiveness and non-excessive burden on economic operators. Member States should conduct efforts to ensure that relevant data is adequately shared between authorities without prejudice to statistical confidentiality in order to ensure that the reporting burden on enterprises is as small as possible.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nReducing response burden is equally important as incorporating new data needs into the production of European statistics. The Commission (Eurostat) should regularly review the use and usability of data and discontinue variables and detailed topics when they are no longer justified by relevant user need.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nThe framework governing labour market statistics on businesses should be continuously improved. That includes data quality aspects as well as the reduction of undue economic burdens. However, new methods and procedures should be duly tested before they are incorporated in the day-to-day activities of national statistical authorities. For that purpose, the Commission (Eurostat) and national statistical authorities should conduct feasibility and pilot studies. Such studies should be initiated by the Commission and should be open to the participation of national statistical authorities on a voluntary basis. In order to draw the right conclusions, the results of those studies should be carefully analysed by the Commission and national statistical authorities. That analysis should be made available to the statistical community and the wider public.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to improve the efficiency of the statistical production processes of labour market statistics and to reduce the statistical burden on respondents, national statistical authorities should have the right to access and use, promptly and free of charge, all national administrative data, privately held data and other sources, and to integrate those data with statistics, to the extent necessary for the development, production and dissemination of European Union labour market statistics on businesses, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nPrivately held data refers to the vast amount of data held by private data holders obtained as a result of their activity, which could be used by statistical authorities to produce official statistics. It might include data held by civil society organisations, among others.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 constitutes the reference framework for this Regulation, including as regards the protection of confidential data including personal data.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common framework for systematic production of high quality European Union labour market statistics on businesses, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States but can rather, by reasons of consistency and comparability, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nThe power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission to amend the list of the detailed topics required to be covered by labour market statistics data on businesses and to supplement this Regulation for the temporary production of additional data for the purpose of addressing additional statistical data needs that cannot be otherwise fulfilled. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (11). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to specify the elements for each topic required to be covered by labour market statistics data on businesses. Likewise, power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts to set out the practical arrangements for the quality reports and their content, and to grant derogations to Member States where the application of this Regulation, or the delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to it, require major changes to be made to a Member State’s national statistical system. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) and delivered an opinion on 25 September 2023.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the appropriate implementation of this Regulation in Member States, a period of at least 12 months after the date of entering into force is needed before the first data collection.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (14) and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2002/58/EC (15) of the European Parliament and of the Council. Within their respective scopes of application, those Regulations and that Directive are to apply to the processing of personal data under this Regulation. In order to guarantee the safeguards adopted under Article 89 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, it is preferable that anonymised or pseudonymised data be used for the processing, sharing and archiving of personal data for statistical purposes under this Regulation.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nThe European Statistical System Committee has been consulted,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter\n\nThis Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of labour market statistics on businesses in the Union.\n\nArticle 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\n‘statistical unit’ means an entity on which data are collected and statistics are compiled;\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\n‘enterprise’ means the smallest combination of legal units as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 (16);

    "texte": "REGULATION (EU) 2025/327 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\nof 11 February 2025\n\non the European Health Data Space and amending Directive 2011/24/EU and Regulation (EU) 2024/2847\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16 and 114 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nThe aim of this Regulation is to establish the European Health Data Space (EHDS) in order to improve natural persons’ access to and control over their personal electronic health data in the context of healthcare, as well as to better achieve other purposes involving the use of electronic health data in the healthcare and care sectors that would benefit society, such as research, innovation, policymaking, health threats preparedness and response, including preventing and addressing future pandemics, patient safety, personalised medicine, official statistics or regulatory activities. In addition, this Regulation’s goal is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal and technical framework in particular for the development, marketing and use of electronic health record systems (‘EHR systems’) in conformity with Union values. The EHDS will be a key element in the creation of a strong and resilient European Health Union.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the imperative of having timely access to quality electronic health data for health threats preparedness and response, as well as for prevention, diagnosis and treatment and for secondary use of such electronic health data. Such timely access could potentially contribute, through efficient public health surveillance and monitoring, to more effective management of future pandemics, to a reduction of costs and to improving the response to health threats, and ultimately could help to save more lives. In 2020, the Commission urgently adapted its Clinical Patient Management System, established by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1269 (4), to allow Member States to share electronic health data of COVID-19 patients moving between healthcare providers and Member States during the peak of that pandemic. However, that adaptation was only an emergency solution, showing the need for a structural and consistent approach at Member State and Union level, both in order to improve the availability of electronic health data for healthcare and to facilitate access to electronic health data in order to steer effective policy responses and contribute to high standards of human health.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis strongly cemented the work of the eHealth Network, a voluntary network of authorities responsible for digital health, as the main pillar for the development of contact-tracing and contact-warning applications for mobile devices and the technical aspects of the EU Digital COVID Certificates. It also highlighted the need for sharing electronic health data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (the ‘FAIR principles’), and ensuring that electronic health data are as open as possible, while respecting the data minimisation principle as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Synergies between the EHDS, the European Open Science Cloud and the European Research Infrastructures should be ensured, and lessons should be learned from data-sharing solutions developed under the European COVID-19 Data Platform.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nGiven the sensitivity of personal electronic health data, this Regulation seeks to provide sufficient safeguards at both Union and national level to ensure a high degree of data protection, security, confidentiality and ethical use. Such safeguards are necessary to promote trust in safe handling of electronic health data of natural persons for primary use and secondary use as defined in this Regulation.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nThe processing of personal electronic health data is subject to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). References to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should be understood also as references to the corresponding provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, where relevant.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nMore and more individuals living in the Union cross national borders to work, study, visit relatives, or for other reasons. To facilitate the exchange of health data, and in line with the need to empower citizens, they should be able to access their health data in an electronic format that can be recognised and accepted across the Union. Such personal electronic health data could include personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including related to the provision of healthcare services, and which reveal information about that natural person’s health status, personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, as well as data determinants of health, such as behaviour, environmental and physical influences, medical care, and social or educational factors. Electronic health data also include data that have been initially collected for research, statistical, health threat assessment, policymaking or regulatory purposes and it should be possible to make them available in accordance with the rules laid down in this Regulation. Electronic health data consist of all categories of those data, irrespective of whether such data are provided by the data subject or other natural or legal persons, such as health professionals, or are processed in relation to a natural person’s health or well-being and should also include inferred and derived data, such as diagnostics, tests and medical examinations, as well as data observed and recorded by automated means.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nIn health systems, personal electronic health data are usually gathered in electronic health records, which typically contain a natural person’s medical history, diagnoses and treatment, medications, allergies and vaccinations, as well as radiology images, laboratory results and other medical data, spread between different actors in the health system, such as general practitioners, hospitals, pharmacies or care services. In order to allow electronic health data to be accessed, shared and modified by natural persons or health professionals, some Member States have taken the necessary legal and technical measures and set up centralised infrastructures connecting EHR systems used by healthcare providers and natural persons. In addition, some Member States provide support to public and private healthcare providers to set up personal electronic health data spaces to enable interoperability between different healthcare providers. Several Member States also support or provide electronic health data access services for patients and health professionals, for instance through patient or health professional portals. Those Member States have also taken measures to ensure that EHR systems or wellness applications are able to transmit electronic health data to the central EHR system, for instance by providing a system of certification. However, not all Member States have put in place such systems, and those Member States that have implemented them have done so in a fragmented manner. In order to facilitate the free movement of personal electronic health data across the Union and avoid negative consequences for patients when receiving healthcare in a cross-border context, Union action is needed to improve natural persons’ access to their own personal electronic health data and to empower them to share those data. In this respect, appropriate action at Union and national level should be taken as a means of reducing fragmentation, heterogeneity and division, and to create a system that is user-friendly and intuitive in all Member States. Any digital transformation in the healthcare sector should aim to be inclusive and also benefit natural persons with limited ability to access and use digital services, including people with disabilities.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 sets out specific provisions concerning the rights of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data. The EHDS builds upon those rights and complements some of them as applied to personal electronic health data. Those rights apply regardless of the Member State in which the personal electronic health data are processed, type of healthcare provider, sources of those data or Member State of affiliation of the natural person. The rights and rules related to the primary use of personal electronic health data under this Regulation concern all categories of those data, irrespective of how they have been collected or who has provided them, the legal ground for the processing under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or the status of the controller as a public or private organisation. The additional rights of access and portability of personal electronic health data provided for in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the rights of access and portability as established under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Natural persons continue to have those rights under the conditions set out in that Regulation.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nWhile the rights conferred by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should continue to apply, the right of access to data by a natural person, established in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should be further complemented in the healthcare sector. Under that Regulation, controllers do not have to provide access immediately. The right of access to health data is still commonly implemented in many places through the provision of the requested health data in paper format or as scanned documents, which is time-consuming for the controller, such as a hospital or other healthcare provider that provides access. That situation slows down access to health data by natural persons, and can have a negative impact on them if they need such access immediately due to urgent circumstances pertaining to their health condition. It is therefore necessary to provide for a more efficient way for natural persons to access their own personal electronic health data. They should have the right to have free-of-charge and immediate access, while respecting the need for technological practicability, to specific priority categories of personal electronic health data, such as the patient summary, through an electronic health data access service. That right should apply regardless of the Member State in which the personal electronic health data are processed, the type of healthcare provider, the sources of those data or the Member State of affiliation of the natural person. The scope of that complementary right established under this Regulation and the conditions for exercising it differ in certain ways from the right of access to personal data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which covers all personal data held by a controller and is exercised against an individual controller, which has up to one month to reply to a request. The right to access personal electronic health data under this Regulation should be limited to the categories of data falling within its scope, be exercised via an electronic health data access service and entail an immediate answer. The rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should continue to apply, allowing natural persons to benefit from their rights under both legal frameworks, in particular the right to obtain a paper copy of the electronic health data.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nIt should be considered that immediate access of natural persons to certain categories of their personal electronic health data could be harmful for the safety of those natural persons or unethical. For example, it could be unethical to inform a patient through an electronic channel about a diagnosis of an incurable disease that is likely to be terminal instead of first providing that information in a consultation with the patient. Therefore, it should be possible to delay the provision of the access to personal electronic health data in such situations for a limited amount of time, for instance until the moment when the health professional can explain the situation to the patient. Member States should be able to establish such an exception where it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society, in line with restrictions as provided for in Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not affect Member States’ competences concerning the initial registration of personal electronic health data, such as making the registration of genetic data subject to the natural person’s consent or other safeguards. Member States may require that data be made available in an electronic format prior to the application of this Regulation. This should not affect the obligation to make personal electronic health data, registered after the date of application of this Regulation, available in an electronic format.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to complement the information available to them, natural persons should be able to add electronic health data to their EHRs or to store additional information in their separate personal health record which could be accessed by health professionals. However, information inserted by natural persons might not be as reliable as electronic health data entered and verified by health professionals and does not have the same clinical or legal value as information provided by health professionals. Therefore, data added by natural persons in their EHR should be clearly distinguishable from data provided by health professionals. That possibility for natural persons to add and complement personal electronic health data should not entitle them to change personal electronic health data which have been provided by health professionals.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nEnabling natural persons to more easily and quickly access their personal electronic health data will enable them to notice possible errors such as incorrect information or incorrectly attributed patient records. In such cases, natural persons should be able to request online the rectification of the incorrect personal electronic health data, immediately and free of charge, through an electronic health data access service. Such rectification requests should then be treated by the relevant controllers in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, if necessary involving health professionals with a relevant specialisation and responsible for the natural persons’ treatment.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nUnder Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the right to data portability is limited to data processed based on consent or contract and provided by the data subject to a controller. Additionally, under that Regulation, natural persons have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another only where technically feasible. Regulation (EU) 2016/679, however, does not impose an obligation to make that direct transmission technically feasible. The right to data portability should be complemented under this Regulation, thereby empowering natural persons to provide access to, at least, priority categories of their personal electronic health data to the health professionals of their choice, to exchange such health data with such health professionals and to download such health data. In addition, natural persons should have the right to request a healthcare provider to transmit a part of their electronic health data to a clearly identified recipient in the social security or reimbursement services sector. Such a transfer should be one-way only.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nThe framework laid down by this Regulation should build on the right to data portability established in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by ensuring that natural persons as data subjects can transmit their personal electronic health data, including inferred data, in the European electronic health record exchange format, irrespective of the legal basis for processing the electronic health data. Health professionals should refrain from hindering the application of the rights of natural persons, for example by refusing to take into account personal electronic health data originating from another Member State and which are provided through the interoperable and reliable European electronic health record exchange format.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nAccess to electronic health records by healthcare providers or other individuals should be transparent to the natural persons concerned. Electronic health data access services should provide detailed information on access to data, such as when and which entity or natural person accessed data and which data were accessed. Natural persons should also be able to enable or disable automatic notifications regarding access to personal electronic health data relating to them through the health professional access services.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nNatural persons might not want to allow access to some parts of their personal electronic health data while enabling access to other parts. This could especially be relevant in cases of sensitive health issues such as those related to mental or sexual health, sensitive procedures such as abortions, or data on specific medication which could reveal other sensitive issues. Such selective sharing of personal electronic health data should therefore be supported and implemented through restrictions set by the natural person concerned in the same way within the territory of a given Member State and for cross-border data sharing. Those restrictions should allow for sufficient granularity to restrict parts of datasets, such as elements of the patient summaries. Before setting the restrictions, natural persons should be informed of the risks for patient safety associated with limiting access to health data. Given that the unavailability of the restricted personal electronic health data may impact the provision or quality of health services provided to the natural person, natural persons making use of such access restrictions should assume responsibility for the fact that the healthcare provider cannot take the data into account when providing health services. The restrictions on access to personal electronic health data could have life-threatening consequences and, therefore, access to those data should nevertheless be possible where necessary to protect vital interests in emergency situations. More specific legal provisions on the mechanisms of restrictions placed by natural persons on parts of their personal electronic health data could be provided for by Member States in their national law, in particular as regards medical liability in cases where restrictions have been placed by the natural person concerned.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nIn addition, due to the different sensitivities in the Member States on the degree of patients’ control over their health data, Member States should be able to provide for an absolute right to opt out from access to their personal electronic health data by anyone other than the original controller, without any possibility to override that opt-out in emergency situations. In such a case, Member States should establish the rules and specific safeguards regarding such opt-out mechanisms. Those rules and specific safeguards could also relate to specific categories of personal electronic health data, for example genetic data. The right to opt out means that personal electronic health data relating to the natural person who exercises that right would not be made available through the services set up under the EHDS other than to the healthcare provider that provided the treatment. Member States should be able to require the registration and storage of personal electronic health data in an EHR system used by the healthcare provider who provided the health services and accessible only to that healthcare provider. If a natural person has exercised the right to opt out, healthcare providers will still document the treatment provided in accordance with applicable rules, and will be able to access the data registered by them. Natural persons who exercise the right to opt out should be able to reverse their decision. In such cases, personal electronic health data generated during the period of the opt-out might not be available via the access services and MyHealth@EU.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nTimely and full access by health professionals to the medical records of patients is fundamental for ensuring continuity of care, avoiding duplications and errors, and reducing costs. However, due to a lack of interoperability, in many cases health professionals cannot access the complete medical records of their patients and cannot make optimal medical decisions for their diagnosis and treatment, which adds considerable costs both for health systems and for natural persons and can lead to worse health outcomes for natural persons. Electronic health data made available in an interoperable format and which can be transmitted between healthcare providers can also reduce the administrative burden on health professionals of manually entering or copying health data between electronic systems. Therefore, health professionals should be provided with appropriate electronic means, such as electronic devices and health professional portals or other health professional access services, to use personal electronic health data for the exercise of their duties. As it is difficult to exhaustively determine in advance which data from the existing data in priority categories are medically relevant in a specific episode of care, health professionals should have a wide access to data. When accessing data relating to their patients, health professionals should comply with the applicable law, codes of conduct, deontological guidelines or other provisions governing ethical conduct with respect to sharing or accessing information, particularly in life-threatening or extreme situations. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in order to limit their access to what is relevant in a specific episode of care, healthcare providers should follow the data minimisation principle when accessing personal electronic health data, limiting the data accessed to data that are strictly necessary and justified for a given service. Providing health professional access services is a task assigned in the public interest by this Regulation and the performance of such task requires the processing of personal data as referred to in Article 6(1), point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This Regulation provides for conditions and safeguards for the processing of electronic health data by the health professional access service in accordance with Article 9(2), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, for instance detailed provisions regarding logging of access to personal electronic health data and that aim to provide transparency towards data subjects. However, this Regulation should be without prejudice to national law concerning the processing of health data for the delivery of healthcare, including national law establishing categories of health professionals that can process different categories of electronic health data.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to facilitate the exercise of the complementary access and portability rights established under this Regulation, Member States should establish one or more electronic health data access services. Those services could be provided at national, regional or local level, or by healthcare providers, in the form of an online patient portal, an application for mobile devices or by other means. They should be designed in an accessible way, in particular for persons with disabilities. Providing such a service to enable natural persons to have easy access to their personal electronic health data is a substantial public interest. The processing of personal electronic health data through those services is necessary for the performance of that task assigned by this Regulation in the sense of Article 6(1), point (e), and Article 9(2), point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This Regulation lays down the necessary conditions and safeguards for the processing of electronic health data in electronic health data access services, such as electronic identification of natural persons accessing such services.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nNatural persons should be able to provide an authorisation to other natural persons of their choice, such as their relatives or other close natural persons, enabling such persons of their choice to access or control the access to the personal electronic health data of the natural persons who provide the authorisation or to use digital health services on their behalf. Such authorisations could also be convenient for other usage by natural persons provided with such an authorisation. Proxy services for enabling and implementing such authorisations should be established by Member States, and be linked to personal electronic health data access services such as patient portals or patient-facing applications for mobile devices. Those proxy services should also enable guardians to act on behalf of their dependents, including minors; in such situations, authorisations could be automatic. In addition to those proxy services, Member States should also establish easily accessible support services to be provided by adequately trained staff dedicated to assisting natural persons when exercising their rights. In order to take into account cases in which the display of some personal electronic health data of dependent persons to their guardians could be contrary to the interests or the will of their dependents, including minors, Member States should be able to provide in national law for limitations and safeguards as well as for mechanisms for their technical implementation. Personal electronic health data access services, such as patient portals or patient-facing applications for mobile devices, should make use of such authorisations and thus enable authorised natural persons to access personal electronic health data falling within the scope of the authorisation. In order to provide a horizontal solution with increased user-friendliness, digital proxy solutions should be aligned with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and the technical specifications of the European Digital Identity Wallet. That alignment would contribute to reducing both the administrative and financial burden for Member States by lowering the risk of developing parallel systems that are not interoperable across the Union.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nIn some Member States, healthcare is provided by primary care management teams, which are groups of health professionals focused on primary care, such as general practitioners, that carry out their primary care activities based on a healthcare plan that they draw up. Other types of healthcare teams also exist in several Member States for other care purposes. In the context of primary use in the EHDS, access should be provided to the health professionals belonging to such teams.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nThe supervisory authorities established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are competent for monitoring and enforcing the application of that Regulation, in particular for the monitoring of the processing of personal electronic health data and for handling any complaints lodged by the natural persons concerned. This Regulation establishes additional rights for natural persons regarding primary use, which go beyond and complement access and portability rights enshrined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Since those additional rights should also be enforced by the supervisory authorities established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Member States should ensure that those supervisory authorities are provided with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of those additional tasks. The supervisory authority or authorities responsible for the monitoring and enforcement of the processing of personal electronic health data for primary use in compliance with this Regulation should be competent to impose administrative fines. The legal system of Denmark does not allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fines are imposed by the competent national courts as a criminal penalty, provided that such an application of the rules has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nMember States ought to strive to adhere to ethical principles, such as the European ethical principles for digital health adopted by the eHealth Network on 26 January 2022 and the principle of health professional-patient confidentiality, in the application of this Regulation. Recognising the importance of ethical principles, the European ethical principles for digital health provide guidance to practitioners, researchers, innovators, policy-makers and regulators.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nThe relevance of different categories of electronic health data for different healthcare scenarios varies. Different categories have also achieved different levels of maturity as regards standardisation, and therefore the implementation of mechanisms for their exchange may be more or less complex depending on the category. Therefore, the improvement of interoperability and data sharing should be gradual and prioritisation of certain categories of electronic health data is needed. Categories of electronic health data such as patient summaries, electronic prescriptions and dispensations, medical imaging studies and related imaging reports, medical test results such as laboratory results and related reports, and discharge reports have been selected by the eHealth Network as most relevant for the majority of healthcare situations and should be considered as priority categories for Member States to implement access to them and their transmission. Where such priority categories of data represent groups of electronic health data, this Regulation should apply to both the groups as a whole and to the individual data entries included in those groups. For example, given that vaccination status is part of a patient summary, the rights and requirements linked to the patient summary should also apply to such vaccination status even if it is processed separately from the patient summary as a whole. When further needs for the exchange of additional categories of electronic health data are identified for healthcare purposes, access to and exchange of those additional categories should be possible under this Regulation. The additional categories should be first implemented at Member State level and the exchange on a voluntary basis of such categories of data in cross-border situations between the cooperating Member States should be provided for in this Regulation. Particular attention should be given to data exchange in border regions of neighbouring Member States where the provision of cross-border health services is more frequent and needs even quicker procedures than across the Union in general.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nThe level of availability of personal health and genetic data in an electronic format varies between Member States. The EHDS should make it easier for natural persons to have those data available in electronic format and to control better the access to and sharing of their personal electronic health data. This would also contribute to the achievement of the target of 100 % of Union citizens having access to their electronic health records by 2030, as referred to in Decision (EU) 2022/2481 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). In order to make electronic health data accessible and transmissible, such data should be accessed and transmitted in an interoperable common European electronic health record exchange format, at least for certain categories of electronic health data such as patient summaries, electronic prescriptions and dispensations, medical imaging studies and related imaging reports, medical test results and discharge reports, subject to transition periods. Where personal electronic health data are made available to a healthcare provider or a pharmacy by a natural person, or are transmitted by another controller in the European electronic health record exchange format, that format should be accepted, and the recipient should be able to read the data and use them for the provision of healthcare or for dispensation of a medicinal product, thus supporting the provision of the healthcare services or the dispensation of the electronic prescription. The European electronic health record exchange format ought to be designed in a way that facilitates translation of electronic health data communicated using that format into the official languages of the Union, to the extent possible. Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/243 (9) provides the foundations for such a common European electronic health record exchange format. The interoperability of the EHDS should contribute to having European health datasets of a high quality. The use of a European electronic health record exchange format should become more widespread at Union and national level. The European electronic health record exchange format could allow for different profiles for its use at the level of EHR systems and at the level of the national contact points for digital health in MyHealth@EU for cross-border data exchange.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nWhile EHR systems are widespread, the level of digitalisation of health data varies in Member States depending on data categories and on the coverage of healthcare providers that register health data in electronic format. In order to support the application of data subjects’ rights of access to and exchange of electronic health data, Union action is needed to avoid further fragmentation. In order to contribute to a high quality and continuity of healthcare, certain categories of health data should be registered in electronic format systematically and in accordance with specific data quality requirements. The European electronic health record exchange format should form the basis for specifications related to the registration and exchange of electronic health data.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nTelemedicine is becoming an increasingly important tool that can provide patients with access to care and tackle inequities. It has the potential to reduce health inequalities and reinforce the free movement of Union citizens across borders. Digital and other technological tools can facilitate the provision of care in remote regions. When digital services accompany the physical provision of a healthcare service, the digital service should be included in the overall care provision. Under Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States are responsible for their health policy, in particular for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care, including the regulation of activities such as online pharmacies, telemedicine and other services that they provide and provide reimbursement for, in line with their national legislation. Different healthcare policies should not, however, constitute barriers to the free movement of electronic health data in the context of cross-border healthcare, for example telemedicine and online pharmacy services.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) No 910/2014 lays down the conditions under which Member States perform identification of natural persons in cross-border situations using identification means issued by another Member State, establishing rules for the mutual recognition of such electronic identification means. The EHDS requires secure access to electronic health data, including in cross-border situations. Electronic health data access services and telemedicine services should enable natural persons to exercise their rights regardless of their Member State of affiliation, and should therefore support the identification of natural persons using any electronic identification means recognised pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. Given the possibility of challenges regarding identity matching in cross-border situations, it might be necessary for Member States of treatment to provide complementary access mechanisms such as tokens or codes to natural persons who arrive from other Member States and receive healthcare. The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts to determine the requirements for the interoperable and cross-border identification and authentication of natural persons and health professionals, including any complementary mechanisms that are necessary to ensure that natural persons can exercise their rights related to personal electronic health data in cross-border situations.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should designate relevant digital health authorities for the planning and implementation of standards for access to and transmission of electronic health data and the enforcement of the rights of natural persons and health professionals, as separate organisations or as part of already existing authorities. The digital health authority staff should not have any financial or other interests in industries or economic activities which could affect their impartiality. Digital health authorities already exist in most of the Member States and they deal with EHRs, interoperability, security or standardisation. When carrying out their tasks, digital health authorities should cooperate in particular with the supervisory authorities established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and supervisory bodies established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. Digital health authorities can also cooperate with the European Artificial Intelligence Board established by Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), the Medical Device Coordination Group established by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), the European Data Innovation Board established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and the competent authorities under Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). Member States should facilitate the participation of national actors in the cooperation at Union level, the conveying of expertise and the provision of advice on the design of solutions necessary to achieve the goals of the EHDS.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nWithout prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, any natural or legal person should have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a digital health authority concerning them or where a digital health authority does not handle a complaint or does not inform the natural or legal person within three months about the progress or outcome of the complaint. Proceedings against a digital health authority should be brought before the courts of the Member States where the digital health authority is established.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nDigital health authorities should have sufficient technical skills, possibly by bringing together experts from different organisations. The activities of digital health authorities should be well-planned and monitored in order to ensure their efficiency. Digital health authorities should take the necessary measures to protect the rights of natural persons by setting up national, regional, and local technical solutions such as national EHR intermediation solutions and patient portals. When taking such necessary protective measures, digital health authorities should apply common standards and specifications in such solutions, promote the application of the standards and specifications in procurement procedures and use other innovative means including reimbursement of solutions that are compliant with interoperability and security requirements of the EHDS. Member States should ensure that appropriate training initiatives are taken. In particular, health professionals should be informed and trained with regard to their rights and obligations under this Regulation. To carry out their tasks, the digital health authorities should cooperate at Union and national level with other entities, including with insurance bodies, healthcare providers, health professionals, manufacturers of EHR systems and of wellness applications, as well as other stakeholders from the health or information technology sector, entities handling reimbursement schemes, health technology assessment bodies, medicinal products regulatory authorities and agencies, medical devices authorities, procurers and cybersecurity or e-ID authorities.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nAccess to and transmission of electronic health data is relevant in cross-border healthcare situations, as it can support continuity of healthcare when natural persons travel to other Member States or change their place of residence. Continuity of care and rapid access to personal electronic health data is even more important for residents in border regions who cross the border frequently to get healthcare. In many border regions, some specialised healthcare services might be available closer across the border than in the same Member State. Infrastructure is needed for the transmission of personal electronic health data across borders, in situations where a natural person is using services of a healthcare provider established in another Member State. The gradual expansion of such infrastructure and its funding should be considered. A voluntary infrastructure for that purpose, MyHealth@EU, was established as part of the actions to achieve the objectives set up in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). Through MyHealth@EU, Member States started to provide natural persons with the possibility of sharing their personal electronic health data with healthcare providers when travelling abroad. Building on that experience, the participation of Member States in MyHealth@EU as established by this Regulation should be mandatory. Technical specifications for MyHealth@EU should enable the exchange of priority categories of electronic health data as well as additional categories supported by the European electronic health record exchange format. Those specifications should be defined by means of implementing acts and should be based on the cross-border specifications of the European electronic health record exchange format, complemented by further specifications on cybersecurity, technical and semantic interoperability, operations and service management. Member States should be required to join MyHealth@EU, comply with its technical specifications and connect healthcare providers, including pharmacies, to it, as this is necessary for enabling natural persons to exercise their rights under this Regulation to access and make use of their personal electronic health data regardless of the Member State where the natural persons are located.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nMyHealth@EU provides a common infrastructure for the Member States to ensure connectivity and interoperability in an efficient and secure way to support cross-border healthcare, without affecting Member States’ responsibilities before and after the transmission of personal electronic health data through it. Member States are responsible for the organisation of their national contact points for digital health and for the processing of personal data for the purposes of the delivery of healthcare, before and after the transmission of those data through MyHealth@EU. The Commission should monitor through compliance checks the compliance of national contact points for digital health with the necessary requirements regarding the technical development of MyHealth@EU as well as with detailed rules concerning the security, confidentiality and protection of personal electronic health data. In the event of serious non-compliance by a national contact point for digital health, the Commission should be able to suspend the services affected by the non-compliance provided by that national contact point for digital health. The Commission should act as a processor on behalf of the Member States within MyHealth@EU and should provide central services for it. To ensure compliance with data protection rules and to provide a risk management framework for the transmission of personal electronic health data, the specific responsibilities of the Member States, as joint controllers, and the Commission’s obligations as processor on their behalf should be specified by means of implementing acts. Each Member State is solely responsible for data and services in that Member State. This Regulation provides the legal basis for the processing of personal electronic health data in MyHealth@EU as a task carried out in the public interest assigned by Union law referred to in Article 6(1), point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. That processing is necessary for the provision of healthcare in cross-border situations, as mentioned in Article 9(2), point (h), of that Regulation.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nIn addition to services in MyHealth@EU for the exchange of personal electronic health data based on the European electronic health record exchange format, other services or supplementary infrastructures could be needed, for example in cases of public health emergencies or where the architecture of MyHealth@EU is not suitable for the implementation of some use cases. Examples of such use cases include support for vaccination card functionalities, including the exchange of information on vaccination plans, or verification of vaccination certificates or other health-related certificates. Such additional use cases would also be important for introducing additional functionality for handling public health crises, such as support for contact tracing for the purposes of containing infectious diseases. MyHealth@EU should support exchanges of personal electronic health data with national contact points for digital health of relevant third countries and systems established at international level by international organisations in order to contribute to the continuity of healthcare. This is particularly relevant for individuals travelling to and from neighbouring third countries, candidate countries, and the associated overseas countries and territories. The connection of such national contact points for digital health of third countries to MyHealth@EU and the interoperability with digital systems established at international level by international organisations should be subject to a check ensuring the compliance of those contact points and digital systems with the technical specifications, data protection rules and other requirements of MyHealth@EU. In addition, given that the connection to MyHealth@EU will entail transfers of personal electronic health data to third countries, such as sharing a patient summary when the patient seeks care in that third country, relevant transfer instruments under Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should be put in place. The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts to facilitate the connection of such national contact points for digital health of third countries and systems established at international level by international organisations to MyHealth@EU. When preparing those implementing acts, the Commission should take into account Member States’ national security interests.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to enable the seamless exchange of electronic health data and ensure respect for the rights of natural persons and health professionals, EHR systems marketed in the internal market should be able to store and transmit, in a secure way, high quality electronic health data. It is a key objective of the EHDS to ensure the secure and free movement of electronic health data across the Union. To that end, a mandatory conformity self-assessment scheme for EHR systems processing one or more priority categories of electronic health data should be established to overcome market fragmentation while ensuring a proportionate approach. Through the self-assessment, EHR systems will prove compliance with the requirements on interoperability, security and logging for communication of personal electronic health data established by the two mandatory EHR software components harmonised by this Regulation, namely the European interoperability software component for EHR systems and the European logging software component for EHR systems (the ‘harmonised software components of EHR systems’). The harmonised software components of EHR systems mainly concern data transformation, although they may imply the need for indirect requirements for data registration and data presentation in EHR systems. Technical specifications for the harmonised software components of EHR systems should be defined by means of implementing acts and should be based on the use of the European electronic health record exchange format. The harmonised software components of EHR systems should be designed to be reusable and to integrate seamlessly with other components within a larger software system. The security requirements of the harmonised software components of EHR systems should cover elements specific to EHR systems, as more general security properties should be supported by other mechanisms such as those under Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). To support that process, European digital testing environments should be set up to provide automated means to test whether the functioning of the harmonised software components of an EHR system is compliant with the requirements laid down in this Regulation. To that end, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to determine the common specifications for those environments. The Commission should develop the necessary software for the testing environments and make it available as open source. Member States should be responsible for the operation of the digital testing environments, as they are closer to manufacturers and better placed to support them. Manufacturers should use those digital testing environments to test their products before placing them on the market while continuing to bear full responsibility for the compliance of their products. The results of the test should become part of the product’s technical documentation. Where the EHR system or any part of it complies with European standards or common specifications, the list of the relevant European standards and common specifications should also be indicated in the technical documentation. To support the comparability of EHR systems, the Commission should prepare a uniform template for the technical documentation accompanying such systems.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nEHR systems should be accompanied by an information sheet that includes information for its professional users and by clear and complete instructions for use, including in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. If an EHR system is not accompanied by such information, the manufacturer of the EHR system concerned, its authorised representative and all other relevant economic operators should be required to add to the EHR system that information sheet and those instructions for use.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nWhile EHR systems specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for processing one or more specific categories of electronic health data should be subject to mandatory self-certification, software for general purposes should not be considered to be an EHR system, even when used in a healthcare setting, and should therefore not be required to comply with this Regulation. That covers cases such as text-processing software used for writing reports that would then become part of written electronic health records, general-purpose middleware, or database management software that is used as part of data storage solutions.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation imposes a mandatory conformity self-assessment scheme for the harmonised software components of EHR systems to ensure that EHR systems placed on the Union market are able to exchange data in the European electronic health record exchange format and that they have the required logging capabilities. That mandatory conformity self-assessment, which would be in the form of an EU declaration of conformity by the manufacturer, should ensure that those requirements are fulfilled in a proportionate way, while avoiding an undue burden on Member States and manufacturers.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nManufacturers should affix in the accompanying documents of the EHR system, and where applicable on its packaging, a CE marking of conformity indicating that the EHR system is in conformity with this Regulation and, in respect of aspects not covered by this Regulation, with other applicable Union law which also requires the affixing of such marking. Member States should build upon existing mechanisms to ensure the correct application of the provisions on the CE marking of conformity under relevant Union law and should take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should remain competent to define requirements relating to any other software components of EHR systems and the terms and conditions for connection of healthcare providers to their respective national infrastructures, which could be subject to third-party assessment at national level. In order to facilitate the smooth functioning of the internal market for EHR systems, digital health products and associated services, it is necessary to ensure as much as possible transparency as regards national law establishing requirements for EHR systems and provisions on their conformity assessment in relation to aspects other than the harmonised software components of EHR systems. Therefore, Member States should inform the Commission of those national requirements so it has the necessary information to ensure that they do not adversely affect the harmonised software components of EHR systems.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nCertain software components of EHR systems could be considered medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 or in vitro diagnostic medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16). Software or modules of software which fall within the definition of a medical device, in vitro diagnostic medical devices or an artificial intelligence (AI) system considered to be high-risk (the ‘high-risk AI system’) should be certified in accordance with Regulations (EU) 2017/745, (EU) 2017/746 and (EU) 2024/1689, as applicable. While such products are required to fulfil the requirements under the respective Regulation governing those products, Member States should take appropriate measures to ensure that the respective conformity assessment is carried out as a joint or coordinated procedure in order to limit the administrative burden on manufacturers and other economic operators. The essential requirements on interoperability of this Regulation should only apply to the extent that the manufacturer of a medical device, an in vitro diagnostic medical device, or a high-risk AI system, which is providing electronic health data to be processed as part of the EHR system, claims interoperability with such EHR system. In such case, the provisions on common specifications for EHR systems should be applicable to those medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices and high-risk AI systems.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nTo further support interoperability and security, Member States should be able to maintain or define specific rules for the procurement, reimbursement or financing of EHR systems at national level in the context of the organisation, delivery or financing of health services. Such specific rules should not impede the free movement of EHR systems in the Union. Some Member States have introduced mandatory certification of EHR systems or mandatory interoperability testing for their connection to national digital health services. Such requirements are commonly reflected in procurement procedures organised by healthcare providers and national or regional authorities. The mandatory certification of EHR systems at Union level should establish a baseline that can be used in procurement procedures at national level.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to guarantee the effective exercise by patients of their rights under this Regulation, healthcare providers developing and using an EHR system ‘in-house’ to carry out internal activities without placing it on the market in return for payment or remuneration should also comply with this Regulation. In that context, such healthcare providers should comply with all requirements applicable to manufacturers as regards such EHR systems that are developed ‘in-house’ and that such healthcare providers put into service. However, given that the healthcare providers may need additional time to prepare for compliance with this Regulation, those requirements should only apply to such systems after an extended transitional period.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations corresponding to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution process of EHR systems. Economic operators should be responsible for compliance in relation to their respective roles in such process and should ensure that they make available on the market only EHR systems which comply with relevant requirements.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nCompliance with essential requirements on interoperability and security should be demonstrated by the manufacturers of EHR systems through the implementation of common specifications. To that end, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to determine such common specifications regarding datasets, coding systems, technical specifications, standards, specifications and profiles for data exchange, as well as requirements and principles related to patient safety and the security, confidentiality, integrity and protection of personal data, and specifications and requirements related to identification management and the use of electronic identification. Digital health authorities should contribute to the development of such common specifications. Where applicable, those common specifications should be based on existing harmonised standards for the harmonised software components of EHR systems and be compatible with sectoral law. Where common specifications have a particular importance in relation to personal data protection requirements concerning EHR systems, they should be subject to consultation with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) before their adoption, pursuant to Article 42(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure there is appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, the system of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) should apply. Depending on the organisation defined at national level, such market surveillance activities could be carried out by the digital health authorities ensuring the proper implementation of Chapter II of this Regulation or by a separate market surveillance authority responsible for EHR systems. While designating digital health authorities as market surveillance authorities could have significant practical advantages for the implementation of health and care, any conflicts of interest should be avoided, for instance by separating different tasks.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nThe staff of market surveillance authorities should have no direct or indirect economic, financial or personal conflicts of interest that might be considered prejudicial to their independence and, in particular, they should not be in a situation that could, directly or indirectly, affect the impartiality of their professional conduct. Member States should determine and publish the selection procedure for market surveillance authorities. They should ensure that the procedure is transparent and does not allow conflicts of interest.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nUsers of wellness applications, including applications for mobile devices, should be informed about the capacity of such applications to be connected and to supply data to EHR systems or to national electronic health solutions in cases where data produced by wellness applications are useful for healthcare purposes. The capability of those applications to export data in an interoperable format is also relevant for data portability purposes. Where applicable, users should also be informed about the compliance of such wellness applications with interoperability and security requirements. However, given the large number of wellness applications and the limited relevance for healthcare purposes of the data produced by many of them, a certification scheme for these applications would not be proportionate. A mandatory labelling scheme for wellness applications for which interoperability with EHR systems is claimed should therefore be established as an appropriate mechanism for providing transparency for the users of wellness applications regarding compliance with requirements under this Regulation, thereby supporting users in their choice of appropriate wellness applications with high standards of interoperability and security. The Commission should set out by means of implementing acts the details regarding the format and content of such label.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should remain free to regulate other aspects of the use of wellness applications, provided that the corresponding rules are in compliance with Union law.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nThe distribution of information on certified EHR systems and labelled wellness applications is necessary to enable procurers and users of such products to find interoperable solutions for their specific needs. A database of interoperable EHR systems and wellness applications, which do not fall within the scope of Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2024/1689, should therefore be established at Union level, similar to the European database on medical devices (Eudamed) established by Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The objectives of the EU database for registration of EHR systems and wellness applications should be to enhance overall transparency, to avoid multiple reporting requirements and to streamline and facilitate the flow of information. For medical devices and AI systems, the registration should be maintained under the existing databases established, respectively, under Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2024/1689, but the compliance with interoperability requirements should be indicated by manufacturers when they claim such compliance, in order to provide information to procurers.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nWithout hindering or replacing contractual arrangements or other mechanisms in place, this Regulation is aimed at establishing a common mechanism to access electronic health data for secondary use across the Union. Under that mechanism, health data holders should make the data they hold available on the basis of a data permit or a health data request. For the purpose of processing electronic health data for secondary use, one of the legal bases referred to in Article 6(1), points (a), (c), (e) or (f), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in conjunction with Article 9(2) thereof is required. Accordingly, this Regulation provides for a legal basis for the secondary use of personal electronic health data, including the safeguards required under Article 9(2), points (g) to (j), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to allow the processing of special categories of data, in terms of lawful purposes, trusted governance for providing access to health data through the involvement of health data access bodies, and processing in a secure processing environment, as well as arrangements for data processing, set out in the data permit. Consequently, Member States should no longer be able to maintain or introduce under Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 further conditions, including limitations and specific provisions requesting the consent of natural persons, with regard to the processing for secondary use of personal electronic health data under this Regulation, with the exception of the introduction of stricter measures and additional safeguards at national level aimed at safeguarding the sensitivity and value of certain data as laid down in this Regulation. Health data applicants should also demonstrate a legal basis referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that allows them to request access to electronic health data pursuant to this Regulation and should fulfil the conditions set out in Chapter IV thereof. In addition, the health data access body should assess the information provided by the health data applicant, based on which it should be able to issue a data permit for the processing of personal electronic health data pursuant to this Regulation that should fulfil the requirements and conditions set out in Chapter IV of this Regulation. For processing of electronic health data held by the health data holders, this Regulation creates the legal obligation within the meaning of Article 6(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in accordance with Article 9(2), points (i) and (j), of that Regulation, for the health data holder to make available the personal electronic health data to health data access bodies, while the legal basis for the purpose of the initial processing, for example the delivery of healthcare, is unaffected. This Regulation also assigns tasks in the public interest within the meaning of Article 6(1), point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to the health data access bodies, and meets the requirements of Article 9(2), points (g) to (j), as applicable, of that Regulation. If the health data user relies upon a legal basis set out in Article 6(1), point (e) or (f), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Regulation should provide for the safeguards required under Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nElectronic health data used for secondary use can bring great societal benefits. The uptake of real-world data and real-world evidence, including patient-reported outcomes, for evidence-based regulatory and policy purposes as well as for research, health technology assessment and clinical objectives should be encouraged. Real-world data and real-world evidence have the potential to complement health data currently made available. To achieve that goal, it is important that datasets made available for secondary use pursuant to this Regulation be as complete as possible. This Regulation provides the necessary safeguards to mitigate certain risks involved in the achievement of those benefits. The secondary use of electronic health data is based on pseudonymised or anonymised data, in order to preclude the identification of the data subjects.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nTo balance the need of health data users to have exhaustive and representative datasets with the need for autonomy of natural persons over personal electronic health data of theirs that are considered particularly sensitive, natural persons should be able to make the decision as to whether their personal electronic health data can be processed for secondary use under this Regulation, in the form of a right to opt out from having those data being made available for secondary use. An easily understandable and accessible user-friendly mechanism to exercise that right to opt out should be provided for. Moreover, it is imperative to provide natural persons with sufficient and complete information regarding their right to opt out, including on the benefits and drawbacks entailed by exercising that right. Natural persons should not be required to give any reasons for opting out and should have the possibility of reconsidering their choice at any time. However, for certain purposes with a strong link to the public interest, such as activities for protection against serious cross-border threats to health or scientific research for important reasons of public interest, it is appropriate to provide for a possibility for Member States to establish, taking into account their national context, mechanisms to provide access to personal electronic health data of natural persons who have exercised their right to opt out, to ensure that complete datasets can be made available in those situations. Such mechanisms should comply with the requirements established for secondary use under this Regulation. Scientific research for important reasons of public interest could for example include research addressing unmet medical needs, including for rare diseases, or emerging health threats. The rules on such overrides should respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and be a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to fulfil the public interest in relation to legitimate scientific and societal objectives. Such overrides should only be available to health data users that are public sector bodies, or relevant Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, entrusted with the performance of tasks in the area of public health, or to another entity entrusted with the performance of public tasks in the area of public health or acting on behalf of or commissioned by a public authority, and only where the data cannot be obtained by alternative means in a timely and effective manner. Those health data users should justify that the use of the override is necessary for an individual health data access application or health data request. When such an override is applied, the safeguards under Chapter IV should continue to be applied by health data users, in particular the prohibition of re-identification or attempting to re-identify the natural persons concerned.\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nIn the context of the EHDS, electronic health data already exist and are being collected by, among others, healthcare providers, professional associations, public institutions, regulators, researchers and insurers in the course of their activities. Those data should also be made available for secondary use, that is to say for processing of data for purposes other than those for which they were collected or produced, however, many of such data are not made available for processing for such purposes. This limits the ability of researchers, innovators, policy-makers, regulators and doctors to use those data for different purposes, including research, innovation, policymaking, regulatory purposes, patient safety or personalised medicine. In order to fully exploit the benefits of secondary use, all health data holders should contribute to this effort in making different categories of electronic health data they are holding available for secondary use, provided that such effort is always made through effective and secured processes, with due respect for professional duties, such as confidentiality duties.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nThe categories of electronic health data that can be processed for secondary use should be broad and flexible enough to accommodate the evolving needs of health data users, while remaining limited to data related to health or known to influence health. They can also include relevant data from the health system, for example electronic health records, claims data, dispensation data, data from disease registries or genomic data, as well as data with an impact on health, for example data on consumption of different substances, socioeconomic status or behaviour, and data on environmental factors such as pollution, radiation or the use of certain chemical substances. The categories of electronic health data for secondary use include some categories of data that were initially collected for other purposes such as research, statistics, patient safety, regulatory activities or policymaking, for example, policymaking registries or registries concerning the side effects of medicinal products or medical devices. European databases that facilitate use or reuse of data are available in some areas, such as cancer (the European Cancer Information System) or rare diseases (for example, the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration and European reference networks (ERN) registries). The categories of electronic health data that can be processed for secondary use should also include automatically generated data from medical devices and person-generated data, such as data from wellness applications. Data on clinical trials and clinical investigations should also be included in the categories of electronic health data for secondary use when the clinical trial or clinical investigation has ended, without affecting any voluntary data sharing by the sponsors of ongoing trials and investigations. Electronic health data for secondary use should be made available preferably in a structured electronic format that facilitates their processing by computer systems. Examples of structured electronic formats include records in a relational database, XML documents or CSV files and free text, audios, videos and images provided as computer-readable files.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nHealth data users who benefit from access to datasets provided for under this Regulation could enrich the data in those datasets with various corrections, annotations and other improvements, for instance by supplementing missing or incomplete data, thus improving the accuracy, completeness or quality of the data in the datasets. Health data users should be encouraged to report critical errors in datasets to health data access bodies. To support the improvement of the initial database and further use of the enriched dataset, Member States should be able to establish rules for the processing and the use of electronic health data containing improvements related to the processing of those data. The improved dataset should be made available free of charge to the original health data holder together with a description of the improvements. The health data holder should make the new dataset available, unless it provides a justified notification to the health data access body for not doing so, for instance in cases in which the enrichment by the health data user is of low quality. It should be ensured that non-personal electronic health data are available for secondary use. In particular, pathogen genomic data hold significant value for human health, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic during which timely access to and sharing of such data proved to be essential for the rapid development of detection tools, medical countermeasures and responses to public health threats. The greatest benefit from pathogen genomics efforts will be achieved when public health and research processes share datasets and cooperate to inform and improve each other.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to increase the effectiveness of the secondary use of personal electronic health data, and to fully benefit from the possibilities offered by this Regulation, the availability in the EHDS of electronic health data described in Chapter IV should be such that the data are as accessible, high-quality, ready and suitable for the purpose of creating scientific, innovative and societal value and quality as possible. Work on the implementation of the EHDS and further dataset improvements should be conducted in a manner that prioritises the datasets that are the most suitable for creating such value and quality.\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nPublic or private entities often receive public funding from national or Union funds to collect and process electronic health data for research, official or unofficial statistics, or other similar purposes, including in areas where the collection of such data is fragmented or difficult, such as in relation to rare diseases or cancer. Such data, collected and processed by health data holders with the support of Union or national public funding, should be made available to health data access bodies, in order to maximise the impact of the public investment and support research, innovation, patient safety or policymaking, benefiting society. In some Member States, private entities, including private healthcare providers and professional associations, play a pivotal role in the health sector. The health data held by such providers should also be made available for secondary use. The health data holders in the context of secondary use should therefore be entities that are healthcare providers or care providers or carry out research with regard to the healthcare or care sectors, or develop products or services intended for the healthcare or care sectors. Such entities can be public, not for profit or private. In line with this definition, nursing homes, day-care centres, entities providing services for people with disabilities, entities carrying out business and technological activities related to care such as orthopaedics and companies providing care services should be considered health data holders. Legal persons developing wellness applications should also be considered health data holders. Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies that process those categories of health and healthcare data as well as mortality registries should also be considered health data holders.In order to avoid a disproportionate burden for natural persons and microenterprises, they should be, as a general rule, exempted from the obligations on health data holders. Member States should, however, be able to extend the obligations of health data holders to natural persons and microenterprises in their national law. To reduce the administrative burden, and in light of the effectiveness and efficiency principles, Member States should be able to require in their national law that health data intermediation entities carry out the duties of certain categories of health data holders. Such health data intermediation entities should be legal persons able to process, make available, register, provide, restrict access to, and exchange electronic health data for secondary use provided by health data holders. Such health data intermediation entities perform tasks that differ from those of data intermediation services under Regulation (EU) 2022/868.\n\n(60)\n\n\t\n\nElectronic health data protected by intellectual property rights or trade secrets, including data on clinical trials, investigations and studies, can be very useful for secondary use and can foster innovation within the Union for the benefit of Union patients. In order to incentivise continuous Union leadership in this domain, it is important to encourage the sharing of clinical trials and clinical investigations data through the EHDS for secondary use. Clinical trials and clinical investigations data should be made available to the extent possible, while taking all necessary measures to protect intellectual property rights and trade secrets. This Regulation should not be used to reduce or circumvent such protection and should be consistent with the relevant transparency provisions laid down in Union law, including for clinical trials and clinical investigations data. Health data access bodies should assess how to preserve such protection while enabling access to such data for health data users to the extent possible. If a health data access body is unable to provide access to such data, it should inform the health data user and explain why it is not possible to provide such access. Legal, organisational and technical measures to protect intellectual property rights or trade secrets could include common electronic health data access contractual arrangements, specific obligations within the data permit in relation to such rights, pre-processing the data to generate derived data that protect a trade secret but nonetheless have a utility for the health data user or configuration of the secure processing environment so that such data are not accessible to the health data user.\n\n(61)\n\n\t\n\nThe secondary use of health data under the EHDS should enable public, private and not-for-profit entities, as well as individual researchers, to have access to health data for research, innovation, policymaking, educational activities, patient safety, regulatory activities or personalised medicine, in line with the purposes as set out in this Regulation. Access to data for secondary use should contribute to the general interest of society. In particular, the secondary use of health data for research and development purposes should contribute to benefiting society in the form of new medicines, medical devices, and healthcare products and services at affordable and fair prices for Union citizens, as well as to enhancing access to and the availability of such products and services in all Member States. Activities for which access in the context of this Regulation is lawful could include using the electronic health data for tasks carried out by public sector bodies, such as the exercise of public duty, including public health surveillance, planning and reporting duties, health policymaking, and ensuring patient safety, quality of care and the sustainability of healthcare systems. Public sector bodies and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies might need to have regular access to electronic health data for an extended period of time, including in order to fulfil their mandate, as is provided for in this Regulation. Public sector bodies could carry out such research activities by using third parties, including sub-contractors, as long as the public sector body remains at all times the supervisor of those activities. The provision of the data should also support activities related to scientific research. The notion of scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner, including technological development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research. Activities related to scientific research include innovation activities such as training of AI algorithms that could be used in healthcare or the care of natural persons, as well as the evaluation and further development of existing algorithms and products for such purposes. It is necessary that the EHDS also contribute to fundamental research, and, although its benefits to end-users and patients might be less direct, such fundamental research is crucial for societal benefits in the longer term. In some cases, the information of some natural persons, such as genomic information of natural persons with a certain disease, could contribute to the diagnosis or treatment of other natural persons. There is a need for public sector bodies to go beyond the scope of ‘exceptional need’ of Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854. However, health data access bodies should be allowed to provide support to public sector bodies when processing or linking data. This Regulation provides for a channel for public sector bodies to obtain access to information that they require for fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by law, but does not extend the mandate of such public sector bodies.\n\n(62)\n\n\t\n\nAny attempt to use electronic health data for measures detrimental to natural persons, such as to increase insurance premiums, to engage in activities potentially detrimental to natural persons related to employment, pensions or banking, including mortgaging of properties, to advertise products or treatments, to automate individual decision-making, to re-identify natural persons or to develop harmful products should be prohibited. That prohibition should also apply to activities contrary to ethical provisions under national law, with the exception of ethical provisions relating to consent to the processing of personal data and ethical provisions relating to the right to opt out, since this Regulation takes precedence over national law in accordance with the general principle of the primacy of Union law. It should also be prohibited to provide access to, or otherwise make available, electronic health data to third parties not mentioned in the data permit. The identity of authorised persons, in particular the identity of the principal investigator, who will have the right pursuant to this Regulation to access electronic health data in the secure processing environment should be indicated in the data permit. The principal investigators are the main persons responsible for requesting access to the electronic health data and for processing the requested data within the secure processing environment on behalf of the health data user.\n\n(63)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not create an empowerment for the secondary use of health data for the purpose of law enforcement. The prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties by the competent authorities should not be among the secondary use purposes covered under this Regulation. Therefore, courts and other entities of the justice system should not be considered health data users for the secondary use of health data under this Regulation. In addition, courts and other entities of the justice system should not be covered under the definition of health data holders and should not therefore be addressees of obligations on health data holders under this Regulation. Moreover, the powers of the competent authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences established by law to obtain electronic health data are unaffected by this Regulation. Likewise, electronic health data held by courts for the purpose of judicial proceedings are outside the scope of this Regulation.\n\n(64)\n\n\t\n\nThe establishment of one or more health data access bodies, supporting access to electronic health data in Member States, is essential to promoting the secondary use of health-related data. Member States should therefore establish one or more health data access bodies to reflect, inter alia, their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure. However, one of those health data access bodies should be designated as a coordinator in the event there is more than one health data access body. Where a Member State establishes several health data access bodies, it should lay down rules at national level to ensure the coordinated participation of those bodies in the European Health Data Space Board (the ‘EHDS Board’). That Member State should, in particular, designate one health data access body to function as a single contact point for the effective participation of those bodies, and ensure swift and smooth cooperation with other health data access bodies, the EHDS Board and the Commission. Health data access bodies could vary in terms of organisation and size, spanning from a dedicated fully fledged organisation to a unit or department in an existing organisation. Health data access bodies should not be influenced in their decisions on access to electronic data for secondary use and should avoid any conflicts of interest. Therefore, members of the governance and decision-making bodies of each health data access body and its staff should refrain from any action that is incompatible with their duties and should not engage in any incompatible occupation. However, the independence of the health data access bodies should not mean that they cannot be subject to control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review. Each health data access body should be provided with the financial, technical and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of its tasks, including those related to cooperation with other health data access bodies throughout the Union. The members of the governance and decision-making bodies of health data access bodies and their staff should have the necessary qualifications, experience and skills. Each health data access body should have a separate public annual budget, which could be part of the overall state or national budget. In order to enable better access to health data and complementing Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) 2022/868, Member States should entrust health data access bodies with powers to take decisions on access to and secondary use of health data. This could consist in allocating new tasks to the competent bodies designated by Member States under Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 or in designating existing or new sectoral bodies responsible for such tasks in relation to access to health data.\n\n(65)\n\n\t\n\nHealth data access bodies should monitor the application of Chapter IV of this Regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the Union. For that purpose, health data access bodies should cooperate with each other and with the Commission. Health data access bodies should also cooperate with stakeholders, including patient organisations. Health data access bodies should support health data holders that are small enterprises in accordance with Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (18), in particular medical practitioners and pharmacies. Since the secondary use of health data involves the processing of personal data concerning health, the relevant provisions of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 apply and the supervisory authorities under those Regulations should remain the only authorities competent for enforcing those provisions. Health data access bodies should inform the data protection authorities of any penalties imposed and any potential issues related to data processing for secondary use and exchange any relevant information at their disposal to ensure enforcement of the relevant rules. In addition to the tasks necessary to ensure effective secondary use of health data, the health data access body should strive to expand the availability of additional health datasets, and promote the development of common standards. They should apply tested state-of-the-art techniques that ensure electronic health data are processed in a manner that preserves the privacy of the information contained in the data for which secondary use is allowed, including techniques for pseudonymisation, anonymisation, generalisation, suppression and randomisation of personal data. Health data access bodies can prepare datasets for the health data user as required under the issued data permit. In that regard, health data access bodies should cooperate across borders to develop and exchange best practices and techniques. This includes rules for pseudonymisation and anonymisation of micro datasets. When relevant, the Commission should set out the procedures and requirements, and provide technical tools, for a unified procedure for pseudonymising and anonymising electronic health data.\n\n(66)\n\n\t\n\nHealth data access bodies should ensure that secondary use is transparent by providing public information about the data permits granted and their justifications, the measures taken to protect the rights of natural persons, the means for natural persons to exercise their rights in relation to secondary use, and the outcomes of secondary use including through links to scientific publications. Where appropriate, that information on the outcomes of secondary use should also include a lay summary to be provided by the health data user. Those transparency obligations complement the obligations laid down in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The exceptions provided for in Article 14(5) of that Regulation could apply. Where such exceptions do apply, the transparency obligations established in this Regulation should contribute to ensuring fair and transparent processing as referred to in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, for example through providing information on the purpose of the processing and the data categories processed, thereby enabling natural persons to understand whether their data are being made available for secondary use pursuant to data permits.\n\n(67)\n\n\t\n\nNatural persons should be informed by the health data holders about significant findings related to their health made by health data users. Natural persons should have the right to request not to be informed of such findings. Member States could lay down conditions on the arrangements for the provision by the health data holders of such information to the natural persons concerned and on the exercise of the right not to be informed. Member States should be able, in accordance with Article 23(1), point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, to restrict the scope of the obligation to inform natural persons whenever necessary for their protection based on patient safety and ethics, by delaying the communication of their information until a health professional can communicate and explain to the natural persons concerned information that potentially can have an impact on their health.\n\n(68)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to promote transparency, health data access bodies should also publish activity reports, every two years, providing an overview of their activities. Where a Member State has designated more than one health data access body, the coordinating body should prepare and publish a common report every two years. Activity reports should follow a structure agreed by the EHDS Board and provide an overview of activities, including information regarding decisions on applications, audits and engagement with relevant stakeholders. Such stakeholders can include representatives of natural persons, patient organisations, health professionals, researchers and ethical committees.\n\n(69)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to support secondary use, health data holders should refrain from withholding the data, requesting unjustified fees that are not transparent or proportionate to the costs of making the data available or, where relevant, to marginal costs of data collection, requesting the health data users to co-publish the research or other practices that could dissuade the health data users from requesting the data. Where a health data holder is a public sector body, the part of the fees linked to its costs should not cover the costs of the initial collection of the data. Where ethical approval is necessary for providing a data permit, the evaluation related to ethical approval should be based on its own merits.\n\n(70)\n\n\t\n\nHealth data access bodies should be allowed to charge fees, taking into account the horizontal rules provided by Regulation (EU) 2022/868, in relation to their tasks. Such fees could take into account the situation and interest of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), individual researchers or public sector bodies. In particular, Member States should be able to establish measures for health data access bodies in their jurisdiction which make it possible to charge certain categories of health data users reduced fees. Health data access bodies should be able to cover the costs of their operations with fees set up in a proportionate, justified and transparent manner. This could result in higher fees for some health data users, if handling their health data access applications and health data requests requires more work. Health data holders should be allowed to also ask for fees for making data available which reflect their costs. Health data access bodies should decide on the amount of such fees, which could also include the fees requested by health data holders. The health data user ought to be charged such fees by the health data access body in a single invoice. The health data access body should then transfer the relevant part of the paid fees to the health data holder. In order to ensure a harmonised approach concerning fee policies and structure, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 should apply to fees charged under this Regulation.\n\n(71)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules on secondary use, appropriate measures that can lead to administrative fines or enforcement measures by health data access bodies or temporary or definitive exclusions from the EHDS framework of health data users or health data holders that do not comply with their obligations should be envisaged. Health data access bodies should be empowered to verify compliance of health data users and health data holders and give them the opportunity to reply to any findings and to remedy any infringement. When deciding on the amount of the administrative fine or on an enforcement measure for each individual case, health data access bodies should take into account the cost margins and the criteria set out in this Regulation, ensuring that those fines or measures are proportionate.\n\n(72)\n\n\t\n\nGiven the sensitivity of electronic health data, it is necessary to reduce risks for the privacy of natural persons by applying the data minimisation principle. Therefore, non-personal electronic health data should be made available in all cases where the provision of such data is sufficient. If the health data user needs to use personal electronic health data, it should clearly indicate in its request the justification for the use of that type of data and the health data access body should assess whether that justification is valid. The personal electronic health data should only be made available in pseudonymised format. Taking into account the specific purposes of the processing, personal electronic health data should be pseudonymised or anonymised as early as possible in the process of making data available for secondary use. It should be possible for pseudonymisation and anonymisation to be carried out by health data access bodies or by health data holders. As controllers, health data access bodies and health data holders should be allowed to delegate those tasks to processors. When providing access to a pseudonymised or anonymised dataset, a health data access body should use state-of-the-art pseudonymisation or anonymisation technology and standards, ensuring to the maximum extent possible that natural persons cannot be re-identified by health data users. Such technology and standards for data pseudonymisation or anonymisation should be further developed. Health data users should not attempt to re-identify natural persons from the dataset provided under this Regulation, and where they do so they should be subject to administrative fines and enforcement measures laid down in this Regulation or possible criminal penalties, where national law so provides. Moreover, a health data applicant should be able to request a response to a health data request in an anonymised statistical format. In such cases, the health data user will only process non-personal data, and the health data access body will remain sole controller for any personal data necessary to provide the response to the health data request.\n\n(73)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that all health data access bodies issue data permits in a similar way, it is necessary to establish a standard common process for the issuance of data permits, with similar requests in different Member States. The health data applicant should provide health data access bodies with several elements of information that would help the body evaluate the health data access application and decide if the health data applicant can receive a data permit, and coherence should be ensured between different health data access bodies. The information provided as part of the health data access application should comply with the requirements established under this Regulation in order to enable it to be thoroughly assessed, as a data permit should only be issued if all the necessary conditions set out in this Regulation are met. In addition, where relevant, that information should include a declaration by the health data applicant that the intended use of the health data requested does not pose a risk of stigmatisation, or of causing harm to the dignity, of natural persons or groups to which the dataset requested relates. An ethical assessment could be requested based on national law. In that case, it should be possible for existing ethics bodies to carry out such assessments for the health data access body. Existing ethics bodies of Member States should make their expertise available to the health data access body for that purpose. Alternatively, Member States should be able to provide for ethics bodies to be part of the health data access body. The health data access body, and where relevant health data holders, should assist health data users in the selection of the suitable datasets or data sources for the intended purpose of secondary use. Where the health data applicant needs data in an anonymised statistical format, it should submit a health data request, requiring the health data access body to provide the result directly. A refusal of a data permit by the health data access body should not preclude the health data applicant from submitting a new health data access application. In order to ensure a harmonised approach between health data access bodies and to limit the administrative burden for the health data applicants, the Commission should support the harmonisation of health data access applications, as well as health data requests, including by establishing the relevant templates. In justified cases, such as in the case of a complex and burdensome request, the health data access body should be allowed to extend the time period for health data holders to make the requested electronic health data available to it.\n\n(74)\n\n\t\n\nAs their resources are limited, health data access bodies should be allowed to apply prioritisation rules, for instance prioritising public institutions over private entities, but they should not discriminate between the national organisations and organisations from other Member States within the same category of priorities. A health data user should be able to extend the duration of the data permit in order, for example, to allow access to the datasets to reviewers of scientific publications or to enable additional analysis of the dataset based on the initial findings. This should require an amendment of the data permit and could be subject to an additional fee. However, in all cases, the data permit should reflect such additional uses of the dataset. Preferably, the health data user should mention them in their initial health data access application. In order to ensure a harmonised approach between health data access bodies, the Commission should support the harmonisation of data permits.\n\n(75)\n\n\t\n\nAs the COVID-19 crisis has shown, the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies with a legal mandate in the field of public health, especially the Commission, need access to health data for a longer period and on a recurring basis. This may be the case not only for specific circumstances provided for in Union or national law in times of crisis but also to provide scientific evidence and technical support for Union policies on a regular basis. Access to such data could be required in specific Member States or throughout the whole territory of the Union. Such Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should be able to benefit from an accelerated procedure for having data made available, ordinarily in less than two months, with a possibility of prolonging the timeline by one month in more complex cases.\n\n(76)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should be able to designate trusted health data holders for which the data permit issuing procedure can be performed in a simplified manner, in order to alleviate the administrative burden for health data access bodies of managing requests for the data processed by them. Trusted health data holders should be allowed to assess the health data access applications submitted under this simplified procedure, based on their expertise in dealing with the type of health data they are processing, and issue a recommendation regarding a data permit. The health data access body should remain responsible for issuing the final data permit and should not be bound by the recommendation provided by the trusted health data holder. Health data intermediation entities should not be designated as trusted health data holders.\n\n(77)\n\n\t\n\nGiven the sensitivity of electronic health data, health data users should not have unrestricted access to such data. All secondary use access to the requested electronic health data should be done through a secure processing environment. In order to ensure there are strong technical and security safeguards in place for the electronic health data, the health data access body or, where relevant, the trusted health data holder should provide access to such data in a secure processing environment, complying with the high technical and security standards set out pursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data in such a secure processing environment should comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including, where the secure processing environment is managed by a third party, the requirements of Article 28 of that Regulation and, where applicable, Chapter V thereof. Such secure processing environment should reduce the privacy risks related to such processing activities and prevent the electronic health data from being transmitted directly to the health data users. The health data access body or the health data holder providing that service should remain at all times in control of the access to the electronic health data, and the access granted to the health data users should be determined by the conditions of the issued data permit. Only non-personal electronic health data which do not contain any personal electronic health data should be downloaded by the health data users from such secure processing environment. Thus, such a secure processing environment is an essential safeguard to preserve the rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the processing of their electronic health data for secondary use. The Commission should assist the Member States in developing common security standards in order to promote the security and interoperability of the various secure processing environments.\n\n(78)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) 2022/868 sets out the general rules for the management of data altruism. Given that the health sector manages sensitive data, additional criteria should be established through the rulebook referred to in that Regulation. Where such rules provide for the use of a secure processing environment for that sector, such secure processing environment should comply with the criteria established in this Regulation. The health data access bodies should cooperate with the competent authorities designated under Regulation (EU) 2022/868 to supervise the activity of data altruism organisations in the health or care sector.\n\n(79)\n\n\t\n\nFor the processing of electronic health data in the scope of a data permit or a health data request, health data holders, including trusted health data holders, health data access bodies and health data users should be deemed each of them, in turn, controllers for a specific part of the process and according to their respective roles therein. Health data holders should be deemed controllers for the disclosure of the requested personal electronic health data to the health data access bodies, while the health data access bodies should in turn be deemed controllers for the processing of the personal electronic health data when preparing the data and making them available to the health data users. Health data users should be deemed controllers for the processing of personal electronic health data in pseudonymised form in the secure processing environment pursuant to their data permits. Health data access bodies should be deemed processors on behalf of the health data user for the processing carried out by the health data user pursuant to a data permit in the secure processing environment as well as for the processing to generate a response to a health data request. Similarly, trusted health data holders should be deemed controllers for their processing of personal electronic health data related to the provision of electronic health data to the health data user pursuant to a data permit or a health data request. The trusted health data holders should be deemed processors for the health data user when providing data through a secure processing environment.\n\n(80)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to achieve an inclusive and sustainable framework for multi-country secondary use, a cross-border infrastructure should be established (‘HealthData@EU’). HealthData@EU should accelerate secondary use while increasing legal certainty, respecting the privacy of natural persons and being interoperable. Due to the sensitivity of health data, principles such as ‘privacy by design’ and ‘privacy by default’ and the concept of bringing questions to data instead of moving those data should be respected whenever possible. Member States should designate national contact points for secondary use, as organisational and technical gateways for health data access bodies, and connect those contact points to HealthData@EU. The Union health data access service should also be connected to HealthData@EU. In addition, authorised participants in HealthData@EU could be research infrastructures established as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) under Council Regulation (EC) No 723/2009 (19), as a European digital infrastructure consortium (EDIC) under Decision (EU) 2022/2481 or similar infrastructures established under other Union legal acts, as well as other types of entities, including infrastructures under the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) or infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Third countries and international organisations could also become authorised participants in HealthData@EU, provided that they are compliant with the requirements in this Regulation. The Commission communication of 19 February 2020 entitled ‘A European strategy for data’ promoted the linking of the various common European data spaces. HealthData@EU should therefore enable the secondary use of different categories of electronic health data, including linking of the health data with data from other data spaces such as those relating to the environment, agriculture and social sector. Such interoperability between the health sector and other sectors such as the environmental, agricultural or social sectors could be relevant for obtaining additional insights on health determinants. The Commission could provide a number of services within HealthData@EU, including supporting the exchange of information amongst health data access bodies and authorised participants in HealthData@EU for the handling of cross-border access requests, maintaining catalogues of electronic health data available through the infrastructure, network discoverability and metadata queries, connectivity and compliance services. The Commission could also set up a secure processing environment, allowing data from different national infrastructures to be transmitted and analysed, at the request of the controllers. For the sake of IT efficiency, rationalisation and interoperability of data exchanges, existing systems for data sharing should be reused as much as possible, such as those being built for the exchange of evidence under the ‘once-only’ technical system of Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20).\n\n(81)\n\n\t\n\nIn addition, given that the connection to HealthData@EU could entail transfers of personal data related to the applicant or the health data user to third countries, relevant transfer instruments under Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 need to be in place for such transfers.\n\n(82)\n\n\t\n\nIn the case of cross-border registries or databases, such as the registries of European Reference Networks for Rare Diseases, which receive data from different healthcare providers in several Member States, the health data access body of the Member State where the coordinator of the registry is located should be responsible for providing access to data.\n\n(83)\n\n\t\n\nThe authorisation process to gain access to personal electronic health data in different Member States can be repetitive and cumbersome for health data users. Whenever possible, synergies should be established to reduce the burden and barriers for health data users. One way to achieve that aim is to adhere to the ‘single application’ principle whereby, with one application, the health data user can obtain authorisation from multiple health data access bodies in different Member States or authorised participants in HealthData@EU.\n\n(84)\n\n\t\n\nThe health data access bodies should provide information about the available datasets and their characteristics so that health data users can be informed of elementary facts about the dataset and assess the possible relevance of those facts to those users. For this reason, each dataset should include, at least, information concerning the source and nature of the data and the conditions for making the data available. The health data holder should, at least every year, check that its dataset description in the national dataset catalogue is accurate and up to date. Therefore, an EU dataset catalogue should be established to: facilitate the discoverability of datasets available in the EHDS; help health data holders to publish their datasets; provide all stakeholders, including the general public, taking into account the specific needs of people with disabilities, with information about datasets placed on the EHDS, such as quality and utility labels and dataset information sheets; and provide health data users with up-to-date data quality and utility information about datasets.\n\n(85)\n\n\t\n\nInformation on the quality and utility of datasets increases the value of outcomes from data-intensive research and innovation significantly while, at the same time, promoting evidence-based regulatory and policy decision-making. Improving the quality and utility of datasets through informed customer choice and harmonising related requirements at Union level, taking into account existing Union and international standards, guidelines and recommendations for data collection and data exchange, such as FAIR principles, also benefits health data holders, health professionals, natural persons and the Union economy overall. A data quality and utility label for datasets would inform health data users about the quality and utility characteristics of a dataset and enable them to choose the datasets that best fit their needs. The data quality and utility label should not prevent datasets from being made available through the EHDS, but provide a transparency mechanism between health data holders and health data users. For example, a dataset that does not fulfil any requirement of data quality and utility should be labelled with the class representing the poorest quality and utility, but should still be made available. Expectations set by frameworks created pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and the relevant technical documentation specified in Annex IV to that Regulation should be taken into account when developing the data quality and utility framework. Member States should raise awareness about the data quality and utility label through communication activities. The Commission could support those activities. The use of datasets could be prioritised by their users according to their usefulness and quality.\n\n(86)\n\n\t\n\nThe EU dataset catalogue should minimise the administrative burden for the health data holders and other database users, be user-friendly, accessible and cost-effective, connect national dataset catalogues and avoid redundant registration of datasets. Without prejudice to the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/868, the EU dataset catalogue could be aligned with the data.europa.eu initiative. Interoperability should be ensured between the EU dataset catalogue, the national dataset catalogues and the dataset catalogues from European research infrastructures and other relevant data sharing infrastructures.\n\n(87)\n\n\t\n\nCooperation and work are ongoing between different professional organisations, the Commission and other institutions to set up minimum data fields and other characteristics of different datasets, for instance registries. That work is more advanced in areas such as cancer, rare diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, risk factor assessment and statistics, and should be taken into account when defining new standards and disease-specific harmonised templates for structured data elements. However, many datasets are not harmonised, raising comparability issues and making cross-border research difficult. Therefore, more detailed rules should be set out in implementing acts to ensure a harmonised coding and registration of electronic health data to enable the supply of such data for secondary use in a consistent way. Such datasets could include data from registries of rare diseases, orphan drugs databases, cancer registries and registries of highly relevant infectious diseases. Member States should work towards ensuring that European electronic health systems and services and interoperable applications deliver sustainable economic and social benefits, with a view to achieving a high level of trust and security, enhancing continuity of healthcare and ensuring access to safe and high-quality healthcare. Existing health data infrastructures and registries can provide models that are useful for defining and implementing data standards and interoperability and should be leveraged to enable continuity and to build on existing expertise.\n\n(88)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should support Member States in building capacity and enhancing effectiveness in the area of digital health systems for primary use and secondary use. Member States should be supported to strengthen their capacity. Activities at Union level, such as benchmarking and exchange of best practices, are relevant measures in that respect. Those activities should take into account the specific circumstances of different categories of stakeholders, such as representatives of civil society, researchers, medical societies and SMEs.\n\n(89)\n\n\t\n\nImproving digital health literacy for both natural persons and health professionals is essential to trust and safety and appropriate use of health data and thus is essential to achieving a successful implementation of this Regulation. Health professionals are faced with profound changes in the context of digitalisation and will be offered further digital tools as part of the implementation of the EHDS. Consequently, health professionals need to develop their digital health literacy and digital skills and Member States should provide access for health professionals to digital literacy courses so that they can prepare to work with EHR systems. Such courses should allow health professionals and IT operators to receive sufficient training in working with new digital infrastructures to ensure cybersecurity and ethical management of health data. The training courses should be developed and reviewed, and kept up to date, on a regular basis in consultation and cooperation with relevant experts. Improving digital health literacy is fundamental in order to empower natural persons to have true control over their health data, actively manage their health and care, and understand the implications of the management of such data for both primary use and secondary use. Different demographic groups have varying degrees of digital literacy, which can affect natural persons’ ability to exercise their rights to control their electronic health data. Member States, including regional and local authorities, should therefore support digital health literacy and public awareness, while ensuring that the implementation of this Regulation contributes to reducing inequalities and does not discriminate against people lacking digital skills. Particular attention should be given to persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups including migrants and the elderly. Member States should create targeted national digital literacy programmes, including programmes to maximise social inclusion and to ensure all natural persons can effectively exercise their rights under this Regulation. Member States should also provide patient-centric guidance to natural persons in relation to the use of electronic health records and primary use of their personal electronic health data. Guidance should be tailored to the patient’s level of digital health literacy, with specific attention to be given to the needs of vulnerable groups.\n\n(90)\n\n\t\n\nThe use of funds should also contribute to attaining the objectives of the EHDS. Public procurers, national competent authorities in the Member States, including digital health authorities and health data access bodies, and the Commission should make references to applicable technical specifications, standards and profiles on interoperability, security and data quality, as well as other requirements developed under this Regulation, when defining the conditions for public procurement, calls for proposals and allocation of Union funds, including structural and cohesion funds. Union funds need to be distributed transparently among the Member States, taking into account the different levels of health system digitalisation. Making data available for secondary use requires additional resources for healthcare systems, in particular public healthcare systems. That additional burden should be addressed and minimised during the implementation phase of the EHDS.\n\n(91)\n\n\t\n\nThe implementation of the EHDS requires appropriate investment in capacity-building and training and a well-funded commitment to public consultation and engagement both at Union and national level. The economic costs of implementing this Regulation will need to be borne at both Union and national level, and a fair sharing of that burden between Union and national funds will need to be found.\n\n(92)\n\n\t\n\nCertain categories of electronic health data can remain particularly sensitive even when they are in anonymised format and thus non-personal, as already specifically provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/868. Even where state-of-the-art anonymisation techniques are used, there remains a residual risk that the capacity to re-identify could be or become available, beyond the means reasonably likely to be used. Such residual risk is present in relation to rare diseases, that is to say a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10 000 persons in the Union, where the limited numbers of cases reduce the possibility of fully aggregating the published data in order to preserve the privacy of natural persons while also maintaining an appropriate level of granularity in order to remain meaningful. Such residual risk can affect different categories of health data and can lead to the re-identification of the data subjects using means that are beyond those reasonably likely to be used. Such risk depends on the level of granularity, on the description of the characteristics of data subjects, on the number of people affected, for instance in cases of data included in electronic health records, disease registries, biobanks and person-generated data, where the range of identification characteristics is broader, and on the possible combination with other information, for example in very small geographical areas, or through the technological evolution of methods which had not been available at the moment of anonymisation. Such re-identification of natural persons would present a major concern and would be likely to put the acceptance of the rules on secondary use provided for in this Regulation at risk. Furthermore, aggregation techniques are less tested for non-personal data containing for example trade secrets, as is the case in the reporting on clinical trials and clinical investigations, and enforcement of breaches of trade secrets outside the Union is more difficult in the absence of a sufficient international protection standard. Therefore, for those categories of health data, there remains a risk of re-identification after the anonymisation or aggregation, which cannot be reasonably mitigated initially. This falls within the criteria indicated in Article 5(13) of Regulation (EU) 2022/868. Those types of health data would thus fall within the empowerment set out in Article 5(13) of that Regulation for transfer to third countries. The special conditions provided for under the empowerment set out in Article 5(13) of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 will be detailed in the context of the delegated act adopted under that empowerment, and need to be proportional to the risk of re-identification and to take into account the specificities of different data categories or of different anonymisation or aggregation techniques.\n\n(93)\n\n\t\n\nThe processing of large amounts of personal electronic health data for the purposes of the EHDS, as part of data processing activities in the context of handling health data access applications, data permits and health data requests entails higher risks of unauthorised access to such personal data, as well as the possibility of cybersecurity incidents. Personal electronic health data are particularly sensitive as they often contain information covered by medical secrecy, the disclosure of which to unauthorised third parties can cause significant distress. Taking fully into consideration the principles outlined in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, this Regulation ensures full respect for fundamental rights, for the right to privacy and for the principle of proportionality. In order to ensure the full integrity and confidentiality of personal electronic health data under this Regulation, to guarantee a particularly high level of protection and security, and to reduce the risk of unlawful access to those personal electronic health data, this Regulation allows Member States to require that personal electronic health data be stored and processed solely within the Union for the purpose of carrying out the tasks provided for in this Regulation, unless an adequacy decision adopted pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 applies.\n\n(94)\n\n\t\n\nAccess to electronic health data for health data users established in third countries or for international organisations should take place only on the basis of the reciprocity principle. Making electronic health data available to a third country should be allowed to take place only where the Commission has established, by means of an implementing act, that the third country concerned allows access to electronic health data originating from that third country by Union entities under the same conditions and with the same safeguards as would be the case if they were accessing electronic health data within the Union. The Commission should monitor and carry out a periodic review of the situation in those third countries and for international organisations and list those implementing acts. Where the Commission finds that a third country no longer ensures access on the same terms, it should revoke the corresponding implementing act.\n\n(95)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to promote the consistent application of this Regulation, including as regards cross-border interoperability of electronic health data, a European Health Data Space Board should be set up. The Commission should participate in its activities and co-chair it. The EHDS Board should be able to issue written contributions related to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by helping Member States to coordinate the use of electronic health data for healthcare and certification, but also concerning secondary use, and the funding for those activities. This could also include sharing information on risks and incidents in the secure processing environments. The sharing of that kind of information does not affect obligations under other legal acts, such as data breach notifications under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. More generally, the activities of the EHDS Board are without prejudice to the powers of the supervisory authorities pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Given that, at national level, digital health authorities dealing with primary use may be different from the health data access bodies dealing with secondary use, the functions are different and there is a need for distinct cooperation in each of those areas, the EHDS Board should be able to set up subgroups dealing with those two functions, as well as other subgroups, as needed. In order for there to be an efficient working method, the digital health authorities and health data access bodies should create networks and links at national level with other bodies and authorities, but also at Union level. Such bodies could comprise data protection authorities, cybersecurity, eID and standardisation bodies, as well as bodies and expert groups under Regulations (EU) 2022/868, (EU) 2023/2854 and (EU) 2024/1689 and Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). The EHDS Board should operate independently, in the public interest and in line with its code of conduct.\n\n(96)\n\n\t\n\nWhere issues that are considered by the EHDS Board to be of specific relevance are discussed, it should be able to invite observers, for instance the EDPS, representatives of Union institutions, including of the European Parliament, and other stakeholders.\n\n(97)\n\n\t\n\nA stakeholder forum should be set up to advise the EHDS Board in the fulfilment of its tasks by providing stakeholder input on matters pertaining to this Regulation. The stakeholder forum should be composed, inter alia, of representatives of patient and consumer organisations, health professionals, industry, scientific researchers and academia. It should have a balanced composition and represent the views of different relevant stakeholders. Both commercial and non-commercial interests should be represented.\n\n(98)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure proper day-to-day management of the cross-border infrastructures for primary use and secondary use, it is necessary to create steering groups consisting of Member State representatives. These steering groups should take operational decisions on the technical day-to-day management of the cross-border infrastructures and their technical development, including on technical changes to the infrastructures, improving functionalities or services, or ensuring interoperability with other infrastructures, digital systems or data spaces. Their activities should not include contributing to the development of implementing acts affecting those infrastructures. The steering groups should also be able to invite representatives of other authorised participants in HealthData@EU as observers to their meetings and should consult relevant experts when carrying out their tasks.\n\n(99)\n\n\t\n\nWithout prejudice to any other administrative, judicial or non-judicial remedy, any natural or legal person should have the right to lodge a complaint with a digital health authority or with a health data access body, if the natural or legal person considers that his or her rights or interests under this Regulation have been affected. The investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent appropriate in the specific case. The digital health authority or health data access body should inform the natural or legal person of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires further investigation or coordination with another digital health authority or health data access body, information on the progress made in dealing with the complaint should be given to the natural or legal person. In order to facilitate the submission of complaints, each digital health authority and health data access body should take measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically, without excluding the possibility of using other means of communication. Where the complaint concerns the rights of natural persons related to the protection of their personal data, the digital health authority or health data access body should transmit the complaint to the supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Digital health authorities or health data access bodies should cooperate to handle and resolve complaints, including by exchanging all relevant information by electronic means, without undue delay.\n\n(100)\n\n\t\n\nWhere a natural person considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed, he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association constituted in accordance with national law, having statutory public interest objectives and active in the field of the protection of personal data, to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf.\n\n(101)\n\n\t\n\nThe digital health authority, health data access body, health data holder or health data user should compensate any damage which a natural or legal person suffers as a result of an infringement of this Regulation. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other provisions in Union or national law. Natural persons should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered.\n\n(102)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties, including administrative fines, should be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead of, appropriate measures imposed by health data access bodies pursuant to this Regulation. The imposition of penalties, including administrative fines, should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of Union law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including effective judicial protection and due process.\n\n(103)\n\n\t\n\nIt is appropriate to lay down provisions enabling health data access bodies to apply administrative fines for certain infringements of this Regulation which should be considered under this Regulation to be serious infringements, such as the re-identification of natural persons, downloading personal electronic health data outside of the secure processing environment or processing of data for prohibited uses or uses not covered by a data permit. This Regulation should specify those infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which should be determined by the competent health data access body in each individual case, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the specific situation, having due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement. For the purposes of the imposition of administrative fines under this Regulation, the concept of undertaking should be understood in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. It should be for the Member States to determine whether and to what extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines. Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning should not affect the enforcement of other powers of the health data access bodies or of other penalties under this Regulation.\n\n(104)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that the EHDS fulfils its objectives, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the modification, addition or removal in Annex I of the main characteristics of the priority categories of personal electronic health data, the list of required data to be entered by the manufacturers of EHR systems and wellness applications into the EU database for registration of EHR systems and wellness applications as well as the modification, addition or removal of elements to be covered by the data quality and utility label. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Inter-institutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (22). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(105)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards:\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntechnical specifications for the interoperability of the proxy services of the Member States,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ndata quality requirements for the registration of personal electronic health data in an EHR system,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ncross-border specifications for priority categories of personal electronic health data,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntechnical specifications for the categories of personal electronic health data, setting out the European electronic health record exchange format,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nupdates of the European electronic health record exchange format to integrate relevant revisions of the healthcare coding systems and nomenclatures,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntechnical specifications to extend the European electronic health record exchange format to additional categories of personal electronic health data,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nrequirements for the interoperable, cross-border identification and authentication mechanism for natural persons and health professionals, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nrequirements for the technical implementation of the rights of natural persons in relation to the primary use of their personal electronic health data,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nnecessary measures for the technical development of MyHealth@EU, detailed rules concerning the security, confidentiality and protection of personal electronic health data and the conditions for compliance checks necessary to join and remain connected to MyHealth@EU,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nrules regarding the requirements of cybersecurity, technical interoperability, semantic interoperability, operations and service management in relation to the processing by the Commission and its responsibilities towards the controllers,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntechnical aspects of supplementary services provided through MyHealth@EU,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntechnical aspects of exchanges of personal electronic health data between MyHealth@EU and other services or infrastructures,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nconnection and disconnection of other infrastructures, of national contact points for digital health of third countries or of systems established at international level by international organisations to or from the central interoperability platform of MyHealth@EU,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ncommon specifications in respect of the essential requirements laid down in Annex II,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ncommon specifications for the European digital testing environment,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\njustifications of national measures taken by market surveillance authorities in the case of non-compliance by EHR systems,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nformat and content of the label of wellness applications,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nprinciples for the fee policies and fee structures regarding the fees that health data access bodies and trusted health data holders can charge for making electronic health data available for secondary use,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nthe architecture of an IT tool aimed at supporting and making transparent to health data access bodies enforcement measures,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nthe logo for acknowledging the contribution of the EHDS,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntemplates for the health data access application, the data permit and the health data request,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntechnical, organisational, information security, confidentiality, data protection and interoperability requirements for the secure processing environments,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ntemplates for agreements between controllers and processors,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ndecisions on the compliance of a national contact point for secondary use of a third country or a system established at international level by international organisations with the requirements of HealthData@EU for the purposes of secondary use of health data, on the compliance with Chapter IV and on whether that national contact point for secondary use or that system provides equivalent access for health data users located in the Union to the electronic health data it has access to,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nHealthData@EU’s requirements, technical specifications and IT architecture; conditions and compliance checks to join and remain connected to HealthData@EU; minimum criteria to be met by national contact points for secondary use and the authorised participants in HealthData@EU; responsibilities of the controllers and processors which participate in HealthData@EU; responsibilities of the controllers and processors for the secure processing environment managed by the Commission; and common specifications for the architecture of HealthData@EU and for its interoperability with other common European data spaces,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ndecisions to connect individual authorised participants to HealthData@EU,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nminimum elements for datasets and the characteristics of those elements to be provided by health data holders,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nvisual characteristics and technical specifications of the data quality and utility label,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nminimum specifications for datasets of high impact for secondary use,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\ndecisions on whether a third country allows Union health data applicants to access electronic health data in that third country under conditions that are not more restrictive than those provided for in this Regulation,\n\n—\n\n\t\n\nnecessary measures for the establishment and operation of the EHDS Board.\n\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).\n\n(106)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should take all measures necessary to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement. When deciding on the amount of the penalty for each individual case, Member States should take into account the limits and criteria set out in this Regulation. Re-identification of natural persons should be considered a serious breach of this Regulation.\n\n(107)\n\n\t\n\nImplementing the EHDS will require significant development work across Member States and central services. To track the progress made in that regard, the Commission should, until the full application of this Regulation, report annually on that progress, taking into account information provided by the Member States. Those reports could include recommendations for remedial measures, as well as an assessment of the progress made.\n\n(108)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to assess whether this Regulation reaches its objectives effectively and efficiently, is coherent and still relevant and provides added value at Union level, the Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation. The Commission should carry out a targeted evaluation of this Regulation within eight years of its entry into force, and an overall evaluation within 10 years of its entry into force. The Commission should submit reports on its main findings following each evaluation to the European Parliament and to the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.\n\n(109)\n\n\t\n\nFor a successful cross-border implementation of the EHDS, the European Interoperability Framework, the scope of which was updated and extended by the Commission communication of 23 March 2017 entitled ‘European Interoperability Framework – Implementation Strategy’ to take on board new or revised interoperability requirements, should be considered as a common reference to ensure legal, organisational, semantic and technical interoperability.\n\n(110)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to empower natural persons by providing them with increased control over their personal electronic health data and supporting their freedom of movement by ensuring that their health data follow them, to foster a genuine internal market for digital health services and products and to ensure a consistent and efficient framework for the reuse of natural persons’ health data for research, innovation, policymaking and regulatory activities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States through coordination measures alone, as shown by the evaluation of the digital aspects of Directive 2011/24/EU, but can rather, by reason of harmonising measures for rights of natural persons in relation to their electronic health data, interoperability of electronic health data and a common framework and safeguards for the primary use and secondary use, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n(111)\n\n\t\n\nThe evaluation of the digital aspects of Directive 2011/24/EU shows that the effectiveness of the eHealth Network is limited, but also that there is strong potential for work at Union level in the area of digital health, as demonstrated by the work carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Directive 2011/24/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n(112)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation complements the essential cybersecurity requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2024/2847. EHR systems which are products with digital elements within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 should therefore also comply with the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in that Regulation. The manufacturers of those EHR systems should demonstrate conformity as required by this Regulation. To facilitate that conformity, manufacturers should be allowed to draw up a single set of technical documents containing the elements required by both legal acts. It should be possible to demonstrate conformity of EHR systems with essential cybersecurity requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 through the assessment framework under this Regulation. However, the parts of the conformity assessment procedure under this Regulation which relate to the use of testing environments should not be applied, since those testing environments do not allow for an assessment of conformity with the essential cybersecurity requirements. As Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 does not cover Software as a Service (SaaS) directly as such, EHR systems offered through the SaaS licensing and delivery model do not fall within the scope of that Regulation. Similarly, EHR systems that are developed and used in-house do not fall within the scope of that Regulation, as they are not placed on the market.\n\n(113)\n\n\t\n\nThe EDPS and the EDPB were consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered their joint opinion on 12 July 2022.\n\n(114)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should not affect the application of the rules of competition, and in particular Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. The measures provided for in this Regulation should not be used to restrict competition in a manner contrary to the TFEU.\n\n(115)\n\n\t\n\nGiven the need for technical preparation, this Regulation should apply from 26 March 2027. In order to support the successful implementation of the EHDS and the creation of effective conditions for European health data cooperation, the implementation should take place in stages,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter and scope\n\n1.   This Regulation establishes the European Health Data Space (EHDS) by providing for common

The Commission shall enable the organisation of exchanges of information necessary for such cooperation.\n\n7.   For medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices or high-risk AI systems referred to in Article 27(1) and (2), the responsible authorities for market surveillance shall be those referred to in Article 93 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, Article 88 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 or Article 70 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, as applicable.\n\nArticle 44\n\nHandling of risks posed by EHR systems and of serious incidents\n\n1.   Where a market surveillance authority of one Member State has reason to believe that an EHR system poses a risk to the health, safety or rights of natural persons or to the protection of personal data, that market surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the EHR system concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Regulation. The manufacturer, the manufacturer’s authorised representative and all other relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority for that purpose and take all appropriate measures to ensure that the EHR system concerned no longer poses that risk when placed on the market or to recall or withdraw the EHR system from the market within a reasonable period.\n\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities of a Member State consider that the non-compliance of the EHR system is not limited to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States’ market surveillance authorities of the results of the evaluation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and of the corrective action which they have required the economic operator to take pursuant to Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.\n\n3.   Where a market surveillance authority finds that an EHR system has caused harm to the health or safety of natural persons or to certain aspects of public interest protection, the manufacturer shall immediately provide information and documentation, as applicable, to the affected natural person or user and, where applicable, other third parties affected by that harm, without prejudice to data protection rules.\n\n4.   The economic operator concerned referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the EHR systems concerned that it has placed on the market throughout the Union.\n\n5.   The market surveillance authority shall without undue delay inform the Commission and the market surveillance authorities, or, if applicable, the supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of other Member States of the corrective action referred to in paragraph 2. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the EHR system concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the EHR system, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n\n6.   Where a finding of a market surveillance authority, or a serious incident it is informed of, concerns personal data protection, that market surveillance authority shall without undue delay inform the relevant supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and cooperate with them.\n\n7.   Manufacturers of EHR systems placed on the market or put into service shall report any serious incident involving an EHR system to the market surveillance authorities of the Member States where such serious incident occurred and of the Member States where such EHR systems are placed on the market or put into service. That reporting shall also include a description of the corrective action taken or envisaged by the manufacturer. Member States may provide for users of EHR systems placed on the market or put into service to be able to report such incidents.\n\nThe reporting required pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be carried out, without prejudice to incident notification requirements under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, immediately after the manufacturer has established a causal link between the EHR system and the serious incident or the reasonable likelihood of such a link and, in any event, not later than three days after the manufacturer becomes aware of the serious incident involving the EHR system.\n\n8.   The market surveillance authorities referred to in paragraph 7 shall inform the other market surveillance authorities, without delay, of the serious incident and the corrective action taken or envisaged by the manufacturer or required of it to minimise the risk of recurrence of the serious incident.\n\n9.   Where its tasks are not performed by the digital health authority, the market surveillance authority shall cooperate with the digital health authority. The market surveillance authority shall inform the digital health authority of any serious incidents, of EHR systems presenting a risk, including risks related to interoperability, security and patient safety, of any corrective action and of any recall or withdrawal of such EHR systems.\n\n10.   In the event of incidents putting at risk patient safety or information security, the market surveillance authorities may take immediate action and require the manufacturer of the EHR system concerned, its authorised representative and other economic operators, if applicable, to take immediate corrective action.\n\nArticle 45\n\nHandling of non-compliance\n\n1.   Where a market surveillance authority makes a finding of non-compliance, it shall require the manufacturer of the EHR system concerned, its authorised representative and all other relevant economic operators to take, by a specific deadline, adequate corrective action to bring the EHR system into conformity. Such findings of non-compliance include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe EHR system is not in conformity with essential requirements laid down in Annex II or with the common specifications referred to in Article 36;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe technical documentation is not available, not complete or not in accordance with Article 37;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up or has not been drawn up correctly in accordance with Article 39;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe CE marking of conformity has been affixed in breach of Article 41 or has not been affixed;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe registration obligations of Article 49 have not been fulfilled.\n\n2.   Where the manufacturer of the EHR system concerned, its authorised representative or any other relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within a reasonable period, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the EHR system from being made available on the market of their Member States, or to recall or withdraw the EHR system from that market.\n\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States’ market surveillance authorities, without delay, of those provisional measures. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant EHR system, the origin of that EHR system, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the measures taken by the market surveillance authorities and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to any of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nfailure of the EHR system to meet the essential requirements set out in Annex II;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nshortcomings regarding the common specifications referred to in Article 36.\n\n3.   Market surveillance authorities other than the market surveillance authorities initiating the procedure under this Article shall inform without delay the Commission and the other Member States’ market surveillance authorities of any measures adopted, of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the EHR system concerned and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n\n4.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2, no objection has been raised by either a market surveillance authority from another Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a market surveillance authority, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n\n5.   Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 persists, the market surveillance authority concerned shall take all appropriate measures to prohibit or restrict the EHR system from being made available on the market or ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market.\n\nArticle 46\n\nUnion safeguard procedure\n\n1.   Where, under Article 44(2) and Article 45(3), objections are raised against a national measure taken by a market surveillance authority, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultations with that market surveillance authority and the relevant economic operators and shall evaluate the national measure concerned. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing decision determining whether the national measure is justified. That implementing decision shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2). The Commission shall address its implementing decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operators.\n\n2.   If the national measure referred to in paragraph 1 is considered justified by the Commission, all Member States concerned shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant EHR system is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly.\n\nIf the national measure referred to in paragraph 1 is considered unjustified by the Commission, the Member State concerned shall revoke that measure.\n\nSECTION 5\n\nOther provisions on interoperability\n\nArticle 47\n\nLabelling of wellness applications\n\n1.   Where a manufacturer of a wellness application claims interoperability with an EHR system in relation to the harmonised software components of EHR systems and therefore compliance with the common specifications referred to in Article 36 and essential requirements laid down in Annex II, such wellness application shall be accompanied by a label, clearly indicating its compliance with those specifications and requirements. That label shall be issued by the manufacturer of the wellness application.\n\n2.   The label referred to in paragraph 1 shall indicate the following information:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe categories of electronic health data for which compliance with essential requirements laid down in Annex II has been confirmed;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\na reference to common specifications to demonstrate compliance;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe validity period of the label.\n\n3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, determine the format and content of the label referred to in paragraph 1.

Such publication shall be without prejudice to publication rights in scientific journals or other scientific publications.\n\nWhen health data users use electronic health data in accordance with this Chapter, they shall acknowledge the sources of the electronic health data and the fact that the electronic health data have been obtained in the framework of the EHDS.\n\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, health data users shall inform the health data access body of any significant finding related to the health of the natural person whose data are included in the dataset.\n\n6.   Health data users shall cooperate with health data access bodies in those bodies’ performance of their tasks.\n\nArticle 62\n\nFees\n\n1.   Health data access bodies, including the Union health data access service, or trusted health data holders referred to in Article 72 may charge fees for making electronic health data available for secondary use.\n\nThe fees shall be in proportion to the cost of making the data available and they shall not restrict competition.\n\nThe fees shall cover all or part of the costs related to the procedure for assessing a health data access application or a health data request, for issuing, refusing or amending a data permit pursuant to Articles 67 and 68 or for providing a response to a health data request submitted pursuant to Article 69, including costs related to the consolidation, preparation, pseudonymisation, anonymisation and provision of the electronic health data.\n\nMember States may establish reduced fees for certain types of health data users located in the Union, such as public sector bodies or Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies with a legal mandate in the field of public health, university researchers or microenterprises.\n\n2.   The fees referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may include compensation for the costs incurred by the health data holder for compiling and preparing the electronic health data to be made available for secondary use. In such cases, the health data holder shall provide an estimate of such costs to the health data access body. Where the health data holder is a public sector body, Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2022/868 shall not apply. The part of the fees linked to the health data holder’s costs shall be paid to the health data holder.\n\n3.   Any fees charged to health data users pursuant to this Article shall be transparent and non-discriminatory.\n\n4.   Where health data holders and health data users do not agree on the level of the fees within one month of the data permit being issued, the health data access body may set the fees in proportion to the cost of making electronic health data available for secondary use. Where health data holders or health data users disagree with the fee set by the health data access body, they shall have access to dispute settlement bodies in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2854.\n\n5.   Before issuing a data permit pursuant to Article 68 or providing a response to a health data request submitted pursuant to Article 69, the health data access body shall inform the health data applicant of the estimated fees. The health data applicant shall be informed about the option to withdraw the health data access application or health data request. If the health data applicant withdraws its application or request, the health data applicant shall only be charged the costs that have already been incurred.\n\n6.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, lay down principles for the fee policies and fee structures, including deductions for the entities referred to in paragraph 1, fourth subparagraph, of this Article in order to support consistency and transparency between Member States regarding such fee policies and fee structures. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2).\n\nArticle 63\n\nEnforcement by health data access bodies\n\n1.   When carrying out their monitoring and supervisory tasks, as referred to in Article 57(1), point (a)(ii), health data access bodies shall have the right to request and receive all the necessary information from health data users and health data holders to verify compliance with this Chapter.\n\n2.   Where health data access bodies find that a health data user or health data holder does not comply with the requirements of this Chapter, they shall immediately notify the health data user or health data holder of those findings and take appropriate measures. The health data access body concerned shall give the health data user or health data holder concerned the opportunity to state their views within a reasonable period that shall not exceed four weeks.\n\nWhere the finding of non-compliance concerns a possible breach of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the health data access body concerned shall immediately inform the supervisory authorities under that Regulation and provide them with all relevant information concerning that finding.\n\n3.   With regard to non-compliance by health data users, health data access bodies shall have the power to revoke the data permit issued pursuant to Article 68 and stop without undue delay the affected electronic health data processing operation carried out by the health data user, and shall take appropriate and proportionate measures aimed at ensuring compliant processing by the health data user.\n\nAs part of such enforcement measures, the health data access bodies may also, where appropriate, exclude, or initiate proceedings to exclude, in accordance with national law, the health data user concerned from any access to electronic health data within the EHDS in the context of secondary use for a period of up to five years.\n\n4.   With regard to non-compliance by health data holders, where a health data holder withholds the electronic health data from health data access bodies with the manifest intention of obstructing the use of electronic health data, or does not respect the deadlines set out in Article 60(2), the health data access body shall have the power to fine the health data holder for each day of delay with a periodic penalty payment, which shall be transparent and proportionate. The amount of the fines shall be established by the health data access body in accordance with national law. In the event of repeated breaches by the health data holder of the obligation of cooperation with the health data access body, that body may exclude or initiate proceedings to exclude, in accordance with national law, the health data holder concerned from submitting health data access applications pursuant to this Chapter for a period of up to five years. During the period of that exclusion, the health data holder shall remain obliged to make data accessible under this Chapter, where applicable.\n\n5.   The health data access body shall communicate the enforcement measures taken pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4, and the reasons on which they are based, to the health data user or health data holder concerned, without delay, and shall lay down a reasonable period for the health data user or health data holder to comply with those measures.\n\n6.   Any enforcement measures taken by the health data access body pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be notified to other health data access bodies through the IT tool referred to in paragraph 7. Health data access bodies may make that information publicly available on their websites.\n\n7.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, set out the architecture of an IT tool, as part of the infrastructure of HealthData@EU referred to in Article 75, aimed at supporting and making transparent to other health data access bodies the enforcement measures referred to in this Article, especially periodic penalty payments, the revoking of data permits and exclusions. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2).\n\n8.   The Commission shall issue guidelines, by 26 March 2032, in close cooperation with the EHDS Board, on enforcement measures including periodic penalty payments and other measures to be taken by the health data access bodies.\n\nArticle 64\n\nGeneral conditions for the imposition of administrative fines by health data access bodies\n\n1.   Each health data access body shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.\n\n2.   Administrative fines shall, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, be imposed in addition to, or instead of, enforcement measures referred to in Article 63(3) and (4). Health data access bodies shall decide whether to impose an administrative fine and the amount of the administrative fine in each individual case by giving due regard to the following circumstances:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe nature, gravity and duration of the infringement;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhether any penalties or administrative fines have already been imposed by other competent authorities for the same infringement;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe intentional or negligent character of the infringement;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nany action taken by the health data holder or health data user to mitigate the damage caused;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe degree of responsibility of the health data user, taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented by that health data user pursuant to Article 67(2), point (g), and Article 67(4);\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nany relevant previous infringements by the health data holder or health data user;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nthe degree of cooperation of the health data holder or health data user with the health data access body as regards remedying the infringement and mitigating its possible adverse effects;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nthe manner in which the health data access body became aware of the infringement, in particular whether, and to what extent, the health data user notified it of the infringement;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\ncompliance with any enforcement measures referred to in Article 63(3) and (4) which have been ordered previously against the controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject matter;\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\nany other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.\n\n3.   If a health data holder or a health data user intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of this Regulation for the same or a linked data permit or health data request, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the most serious infringement.\n\n4.   In accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, infringements of the duties of the health data holder or health data user pursuant to Article 60 and Article 61(1), (5) and (6) shall be subject to administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or, in the case of an undertaking, of a maximum of 2 % of its total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\n\n5.   In accordance with paragraph 2, the following infringements shall be subject to administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of an undertaking, of a maximum of 4 % of its total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nhealth data users processing electronic health data obtained via a data permit issued pursuant to Article 68 for the uses referred to in Article 54;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nhealth data users extracting personal electronic health data from secure processing environments;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nre-identifying or attempting to re-identify the natural persons to whom the electronic health data obtained by the health data users on the basis of a data permit or a health data request pursuant to Article 61(3) relate;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nnon-compliance with enforcement measures taken by the health data access body pursuant to Article 63(3) and (4).\n\n6.   Without prejudice to the powers of health data access bodies pursuant to Article 63, each Member State may lay down rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and public sector bodies established in that Member State.\n\n7.   The exercise by a health data access body of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and national law, including effective judicial remedies and due process.\n\n8.   Where the legal system of a Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied in a manner that, in accordance with its national legal framework, ensures that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed by health data access bodies. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The Member State concerned shall notify the Commission of the provisions of the laws which it adopts pursuant to this paragraph by 26 March 2029 and, without delay, of any subsequent law amending such provisions or amendments affecting such provisions.\n\nArticle 65\n\nRelationship with supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679\n\nThe supervisory authority or authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall also be competent for monitoring and enforcing the application of the right to opt out from the processing of personal electronic health data for secondary use pursuant to Article 71. Those supervisory authorities shall be empowered to impose administrative fines up to the amount referred to in Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\nThe supervisory authorities referred to in the first paragraph of this Article and the health data access bodies referred to in Article 55 of this Regulation shall, where relevant, cooperate in the enforcement of this Regulation, within the remit of their respective competences. The relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nSECTION 3\n\nAccess to electronic health data for secondary use\n\nArticle 66\n\nData minimisation and purpose limitation\n\n1.   Where health data access bodies receive a health data access application, they shall ensure that access is only provided to electronic health data that are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose of processing indicated in the health data access application by the health data user and in line with the data permit issued pursuant to Article 68.\n\n2.   Health data access bodies shall provide electronic health data in an anonymised format, where the purpose of processing by the health data user can be achieved with such data, taking into account the information provided by the health data user.\n\n3.   Where the health data user has sufficiently demonstrated that the purpose of processing cannot be achieved with anonymised data in accordance with Article 68(1), point (c), health data access bodies shall provide access to electronic health data in pseudonymised format. The information necessary to reverse the pseudonymisation shall be available only to the health data access body or an entity that acts as a trusted third party in accordance with national law.\n\nArticle 67\n\nHealth data access applications\n\n1.   A natural or legal person may submit a health data access application for the purposes referred to in Article 53(1) to a health data access body.\n\n2.   The health data access application shall include:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe health data applicant’s identity, a description of that health data applicant’s professional functions and activities, including the identity of the natural persons who would have access to the electronic health data if a data permit were issued; the health data applicant shall notify the health data access body of any update of the list of natural persons;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe purposes referred to in Article 53(1) for which access to data is applied for;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\na detailed explanation of the intended use of the electronic health data and expected benefit related to that use and how that benefit would contribute to the purposes referred to in Article 53(1);\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\na description of the requested electronic health data, including their scope, time range, format, sources and, where possible, the geographical coverage where such data are requested from health data holders in several Member States or from authorised participants in HealthData@EU referred to in Article 75;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\na description explaining whether the electronic health data need to be made available in a pseudonymised or anonymised format; in the case of a pseudonymised format, a justification as to why the processing cannot be carried out using anonymised data;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the health data applicant intends to bring datasets already held by that health data applicant into the secure processing environment, a description of those datasets;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\na description of the safeguards, which are to be proportionate to the risks, planned to prevent any misuse of the electronic health data, as well as to protect the rights and interests of the health data holder and of the natural persons concerned, including to prevent any re-identification of natural persons in the dataset;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\na justified indication of the period during which the electronic health data are needed for processing in a secure processing environment;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\na description of the tools and computing resources needed for a secure processing environment;\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\nwhere applicable, information on any assessment of ethical aspects of the processing, required under national law, which may serve to replace the health data applicant’s own ethics assessment;\n\n(k)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the health data applicant intends to make use of an exception under Article 71(4), the justification required by national law pursuant to that Article.\n\n3.   When seeking access to electronic health data held by health data holders established in more than one Member State or from the relevant authorised participants in HealthData@EU referred to in Article 75, the health data applicant shall submit a single health data access application through the health data access body of the Member State where the main establishment of the health data applicant is located, through the health data access body of the Member State in which one of those health data holders is established or through the services provided by the Commission in HealthData@EU referred to in Article 75. The health data access application shall be automatically forwarded to the relevant authorised participants in HealthData@EU and to the health data access bodies of the Member States where the health data holders identified in the health data access application are established.\n\n4.   When seeking access to the personal electronic health data in a pseudonymised format, the health data applicant shall provide, together with the health data access application, a description of how the processing would comply with applicable Union and national law on data protection and privacy, in particular with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, more specifically, with Article 6(1) thereof.\n\n5.   Public sector bodies and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies shall provide the same information as required under paragraphs 2 and 4, except for paragraph 2, point (h), in which case they shall submit instead information concerning the period for which the electronic health data can be accessed, the frequency of that access or the frequency of the data updates.\n\nArticle 68\n\nData permit\n\n1.   For the purposes of granting access to electronic health data, the health data access bodies shall assess whether all the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe purposes described in the health data access application correspond to one or more of the purposes listed in Article 53(1);\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe requested data are necessary, adequate and proportionate for the purposes described in the health data access application, taking into account data minimisation and purpose limitation requirements provided for in Article 66;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe processing complies with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in the case of pseudonymised data, there is sufficient justification that the purpose cannot be achieved with anonymised data;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe health data applicant is qualified in relation to the intended purposes of data use and has appropriate expertise, including professional qualifications in the areas of healthcare, care, public health or research, consistent with ethical practice and applicable laws and regulations;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe health data applicant demonstrates sufficient technical and organisational measures to prevent the misuse of the electronic health data and to protect the rights and interests of the health data holder and of the natural persons concerned;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthe information on the assessment of ethical aspects of the processing, referred to in Article 67(2), point (j), where applicable, complies with national law;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the health data applicant intends to make use of an exception under Article 71(4), the justification required by national law adopted pursuant to that Article has been provided;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nall other requirements in this Chapter are fulfilled by the health data applicant.\n\n2.   The health data access body shall also take into account the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nrisks for national defence, security, public security and public order;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe risk of undermining the confidentiality of data in governmental databases of regulatory authorities.\n\n3.   Where the health data access body concludes that the requirements in paragraph 1 are fulfilled and the risks referred to in paragraph 2 are sufficiently mitigated, the health data access body shall grant access to electronic health data by issuing a data permit. Health data access bodies shall refuse all health data access applications where the requirements in this Chapter are not fulfilled.\n\nWhere the requirements for issuing a data permit are not met, but the requirements to provide a response in an anonymised statistical format under Article 69 are, the health data access body may decide to provide such response, on condition that providing that response would mitigate the risks and, if the purpose of the health data access application can be fulfilled in this manner, that the health data applicant agrees to receiving a response in an anonymised statistical format under Article 69.\n\n4.   By way of derogation from Regulation (EU) 2022/868, the health data access body shall issue or refuse a data permit within three months of receiving a complete health data access application. If the health data access body finds that the health data access application is incomplete, it shall notify the health data applicant, which shall be given the possibility of completing that application. If the health data applicant does not complete the health data access application within four weeks, the data permit shall not be issued.\n\nThe health data access body may extend the period for responding to a health data access application by three additional months where necessary, taking into account the urgency and complexity of the health data access application and the volume of health data access applications submitted for decision. In such cases, the health data access body shall notify the health data applicant as soon as possible that more time is needed for examining the health data access application, together with the reasons for the delay.\n\n5.   When handling a health data access application for cross-border access to electronic health data referred to in Article 67(3), health data access bodies and relevant authorised participants in HealthData@EU referred to in Article 75 shall remain responsible for adopting decisions to grant or refuse access to electronic health data within their remit in accordance with this Chapter.\n\nThe health data access bodies and authorised participants in HealthData@EU concerned shall inform each other of their decisions. They may take that information into consideration when deciding on granting or refusing access to electronic health data.\n\nA data permit issued by one health data access body may benefit from mutual recognition by the other health data access bodies.\n\n6.   Member States shall provide for an accelerated health data access application procedure for public sector bodies and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies with a legal mandate in the field of public health if the processing of electronic health data is to be carried out for the purposes established in Article 53(1), points (a), (b) and (c).\n\nWhen such accelerated procedure applies, the health data access body shall issue or refuse a data permit within two months of receiving a complete health data access application. The health data access body may extend the period for responding to a health data access application by one additional month where necessary.\n\n7.   Following the issuance of the data permit, the health data access body shall immediately request the electronic health data from the health data holder. The health data access body shall make available the electronic health data to the health data user within two months of receiving them from the health data holders, unless the health data access body specifies that the data are to be provided within a longer specified timeframe.\n\n8.   In cases referred to in paragraph 5, first subparagraph, of this Article, the health data access bodies and authorised participants in HealthData@EU which issued a data permit or access approval, respectively, may decide to provide access to the electronic health data in the secure processing environment provided by the Commission as referred to in Article 75(9).\n\n9.   Where the health data access body refuses to issue a data permit, it shall provide a justification for that refusal to the health data applicant.\n\n10.   When issuing a data permit, the health data access body shall set out in that data permit the general conditions applicable to the health data user. The data permit shall contain the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe categories, specification and format of the electronic health data to be accessed, which are covered by the data permit, including their sources and an indication of whether the electronic health data are to be accessed in a pseudonymised format in the secure processing environment;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\na detailed description of the purpose for which the electronic health data are made available;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nwhere a mechanism to implement an exception is provided for and applicable under Article 71(4), information on whether it has been applied and the reason for the related decision;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe identity of authorised persons, in particular the identity of the principal investigator, with access rights to the electronic health data in the secure processing environment;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe duration of the data permit;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\ninformation about the technical characteristics and tools available to the health data user within the secure processing environment;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nthe fees to be paid by the health data user;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nany specific conditions.\n\n11.   Health data users shall have the right to access and process the electronic health data in a secure processing environment in accordance with the data permit issued to them on the basis of this Regulation.\n\n12.   A data permit shall be issued for the duration necessary to fulfil the requested purposes and that duration shall not exceed 10 years. That duration may be extended once, for a period which does not exceed 10 years, at the request of the health data user, based on arguments and documents to justify that extension which shall be provided one month before the expiry of the data permit. The health data access body may charge fees which increase to reflect the costs and risks of storing electronic health data for a period exceeding the initial period. In order to reduce such costs and fees, the health data access body may also propose to the health data user to store the dataset in a storage system with reduced capabilities. Such reduced capabilities shall not affect the security of the processed dataset. The electronic health data within the secure processing environment shall be deleted within six months of the expiry of the data permit. At the request of the health data user, the formula for the creation of the requested dataset may be stored by the health data access body.\n\n13.   If the data permit needs to be updated, the health data user shall submit a request for an amendment of the data permit.\n\n14.   The Commission may, by means of an implementing act, develop a logo for acknowledging the contribution of the EHDS.

In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nIn accordance with Council Decision 2001/748/EC (3) the Commission signed the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (4) (the ‘UN Firearms Protocol’) on behalf of the European Union on 16 January 2002.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nThe UN Firearms Protocol, the purpose of which is to promote, facilitate and strengthen cooperation among States Parties in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, entered into force on 3 July 2005.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to implement the UN Firearms Protocol, the Union adopted Regulation (EU) No 258/2012. The UN Firearms Protocol was ratified by the Union by Council Decision 2014/164/EU (5).\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nStates Parties to the UN Firearms Protocol are required to put in place or improve administrative procedures or systems to exercise effective control over the manufacturing, marking, import and export of firearms.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nNeither the UN Firearms Protocol nor this Regulation applies to state-to-state transactions or to state transfers in cases where such application would prejudice the right of a State Party to take action in the interest of national security consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not affect the application of Article 346 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which refers to essential interests of the security of the Member States connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material. Nevertheless, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, that provision cannot be construed as conferring on Member States a power to depart from the provisions of the TFEU simply in reliance on those interests. Thus, Member States wishing to avail themselves of the derogation allowed under Article 346 TFEU, must show that such derogation is necessary in order to protect their essential security interests. This Regulation does not have any impact on Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should be consistent with the other relevant provisions on firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators for military use, security strategies, illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, and exports of military technology, including Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP (7) and Council Decision (CFSP) 2021/38 (8).\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should not apply to transactions in firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators that, in the direct or indirect framework of contractual relationships or substantiated by end-user certificates, are destined for the armed forces, the police, or the public authorities. The exclusion should encompass transactions in such goods for development, testing, production, maintenance or presentation, involving private entities, when the final product is exclusively designed for or delivered to the armed forces, the police or the public authorities. The exclusion should not be applicable to Category C items sent to third countries, such as firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, or sound moderators.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not affect the application of Directive (EU) 2021/555 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), which addresses transfers of firearms for civilian use within the territory of the Union. This Regulation applies only to imports into the customs territory of the Union, to transit and to exports from the customs territory of the Union. Therefore, firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons and deactivated firearms released into free circulation in the customs territory of the Union are subject to the requirements of Directive (EU) 2021/555. In addition, this Regulation neither regulates the ownership of weapons nor any licensing of private persons, dealers or brokers. Directive (EU) 2021/555 establishes rules on acquisition and possession, which includes the licensing of private persons, dealers and brokers.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items established by Regulation (EU) 2021/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States under restrictive measures adopted by a decision or a common position of the Council, or resulting from the obligations imposed by Council Common Position 2003/468/CFSP (11).\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nNothing in this Regulation constrains any powers under and pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of Council (12) or Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 (13).\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nDue to the nature of the goods covered by this Regulation, some customs simplifications, such as oral declarations, cannot be applied.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nWhen firearms are not properly marked in accordance with Article 8 of the UN Firearms Protocol, Member States should be able to decide to destroy retained firearms at the expense of the importer.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nFirearms, essential components and ammunition should be declared for release for free circulation only if they are properly marked in accordance with Directive (EU) 2021/555. Pending that marking, importers should place the firearms under another customs procedure, such as customs warehousing, inward processing or free zones, under which they should fulfil the marking requirement, be it in their own premises or in other authorised premises, such as national proof-houses, in line with Union customs legislation. However, persons whose business consists of the manufacture, trade, exchange, hiring out, repair, modification or conversion of firearms, essential components and ammunition should be allowed to mark firearms, essential components and ammunition, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2021/555, without delay after their release into free circulation, since that Directive allows this and prevents the placing of unmarked goods on the market. However, those persons should comply with the requirement set out in Article 8(1), point (b), of the UN Firearms Protocol, which indicates the need to add import markings to firearms.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nDeactivated firearms should be declared for release for free circulation or temporary admission in cases of non-established persons so authorised by this Regulation, only if they are accompanied by the relevant deactivation certificate and are marked pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2403 (14). Pending the reception of that certificate or correct marking, importers should place the deactivated firearms under another customs procedure, such as customs warehousing or free zones, under which they should be able to request the authorities competent under Article 15 of Directive (EU) 2021/555 to verify the deactivation and issue the certificate in accordance with Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2403.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nWhen granting import or export authorisations and when alarm and signal weapons are imported and exported, only alarm and signal weapons complying with the standards under Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/69 (15) should be considered alarm and signal weapons rather than firearms. Devices which can be easily converted into firearms should always be classified as firearms in accordance with customs nomenclature, and be dealt with as firearms by customs authorities and competent authorities. To avoid risks of diversion, it is necessary to ensure the consistency of the practices of national customs authorities in the classification of devices declared as alarm and signal weapons upon import.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nAn import authorisation should be necessary for the entry of firearms, essential components and ammunition into the customs territory of the Union. Due to the high risk of illicit manufacturing of firearms from imported unfinished and unmarked products, only duly licensed dealers and brokers should be authorised to import semi-finished firearms and semi-finished essential components.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nChecks on the criminal records of applicants for import authorisations should be as stringent as they are in respect of applications for export authorisations, and Member States should obtain the information on criminal records through the system established by Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA (16). Competent authorities should check whether the firearms to be imported are registered as lost, stolen or otherwise sought for seizure through the Schengen Information System (SIS). Article 47 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) establishes the access of registration services for firearms to SIS. For the purposes of the implementation of this Regulation, competent authorities should be considered as registration services for firearms.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nA criminal record concerning conduct constituting an offence listed in Article 2(2) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA (18) should constitute a reason to prohibit the import of firearms, essential components and ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nIt is possible for persons not established in the customs territory of the Union to obtain an authorisation to temporarily import and export firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, or sound moderators for the purposes of exhibitions, repairs, hunting, sport shooting or historical re-enactment. The information related to such firearms or other items declared for temporary admission should be clearly spelled out, to enable customs and other competent authorities to proceed efficiently with the discharge and limit the risk of such firearms or other items remaining illegally on the customs territory of the Union.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nArticle 10 of the UN Firearms Protocol allows States Parties to adopt simplified procedures for temporary import and export for verifiable lawful purposes. Consequently, this Regulation facilitates authorisations for multiple shipments, transit measures and temporary import and export for the purposes of exhibitions, evaluations, repairs, hunting, sport shooting and historical re-enactment.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nThere is a risk of diversion of firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators originating from a third country and entering and passing through the customs territory of the Union placed under a customs transit procedure with the final destination in a third country. Therefore, customs authorities and competent authorities should expressly authorise such transit on the customs territory of the Union before it takes place.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to limit the administrative burden, persons in the Union authorised to possess firearms should in specific cases be exempt from the requirement to obtain import and export authorisations. However, for reasons of security and to facilitate controls, traceability should be maintained in those cases.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to improve legal certainty and the predictability of movements, the consent of each Member State affected by the planned movement should be obtained before a Member State grants an import authorisation. A similar consent should be sought when the planned re-entry point of goods temporarily exported is located in the territory of a different Member State.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation enables Member States to adopt measures in the field of import provided that those measures are adopted in conformity with the TFEU. Such prohibitions or restrictions should not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade. The Commission should be informed if, as a result of unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary. This Regulation should lay down the conditions under which those measures should be authorised by the Commission.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to clarify that a person that wishes to export firearms, essential components, ammunition, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators should hold an export authorisation. Eligibility to apply for such an authorisation should be limited to exporters allowed to possess, deal in or broker those goods in accordance with Directive (EU) 2021/555.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nPersons exporting in the course of their business activities should be able to benefit from an export authorisation valid for a maximum of 3 years, including if it is covered by several successive short-term import authorisations issued by importing third countries. Additional Union general authorisations should be introduced in order to reduce the administrative burden on authorised economic operators for security and safety, except in respect of the most dangerous firearms. Member States should also be able to introduce national general export authorisations where they consider it necessary.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nBefore authorising an export, it is important to verify that the importing third country has authorised the corresponding import and that any third countries of transit do not have objections to the specific movement. In order to improve legal certainty and predictability, the consent of the third country of transit should be considered as given, if no objections to the transit have been received. Decisions of Member States to require express consent need to be transparent for all economic operators. It should be the responsibility of the exporter to provide to the competent authorities the relevant documents.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to harmonise the rules on evidence of import in the third country of destination. Therefore, persons exporting should be required to provide to the competent authority which issued the export authorisation, proof of the receipt of the dispatched shipment of firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators in the third country of import, which should in particular be ensured by producing the relevant customs importation documents.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nWhen granting authorisations, Member States should respect the obligations with regard to restrictive measures imposed by decisions adopted by the Council or by a decision of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) or by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations, in particular as regards arms embargoes. To the extent that those international obligations are implemented in national law, it is appropriate to clarify that this Regulation does not prevent the application of that law.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nBefore authorising an export, it is important to verify that no other Member State has previously refused an essentially identical transaction. In order to facilitate that verification, Member States should exchange information on refusals. In addition to the electronic exchange of information about refusals, Member States should also check existing relevant databases, such as the conventional arms export database (COARM).\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to ensure that the conditions for granting an authorisation continue to be met throughout the duration of the authorisation, as is the case of authorisations pursuant to Directive (EU) 2021/555 to possess or acquire a firearm inside the Union.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nCompetent authorities should inform customs authorities of any annulment, suspension, modification or revocation of an authorisation. The obligation to make that information available should be without prejudice to any appeal procedure applicable under national law.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nTo avoid risks of diversion, while limiting the administrative burden, it is necessary to investigate suspicious situations in which Member States should request confirmation of receipt by the authorities of the third country of destination. If such confirmation of receipt cannot be obtained for any reason, that information should be recorded in the electronic licensing system for future reference.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of competent authorities with respect to post-shipment checks.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, in order to ensure the traceability of firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators, it is of the utmost importance that competent authorities be granted access to the Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol). That access should be limited and proportionate to the purpose of fulfilling the obligations laid down in this Regulation. Member States that apply Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and the Council (19) should grant that access.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nTo enable a risk-based assessment approach for the firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators listed in Annex I entering or leaving the Union market, and to ensure that checks are effective and performed in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation, the Commission, competent authorities and customs authorities should cooperate closely and exchange information.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to facilitate the tracing of firearms and efficiently combat illicit trafficking in firearms, essential components, ammunition, alarm and signal weapons, deactivated firearms, semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators, it is necessary to improve the exchange of information between Member States, in particular through the better use of existing communication channels as well as through the Firearms Imports and Exports Coordination Group and international cooperation.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nPersonal data are to be processed in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (20) and (EU) 2018/1725 (21) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nConsistency should be ensured with regard to record-keeping provisions in force under Union law.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nThe Schengen acquis includes in particular a Decision of the Executive Committee (SCH/Com-ex (99) 10) (22), pursuant to which Member States are to submit each year by 31 July their national annual data for the preceding year on illegal trade in firearms, on the basis of the joint table for compiling statistics. In addition, in its recommendation of 17 April 2018 on immediate steps to improve security of export, import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, the Commission recommended that Member States should collect detailed statistics of the preceding year about the number of authorisations, refusals, the quantities and values of firearms exports and imports, by origin or destination, and submit those statistics to the Commission. This Regulation should enable the Commission to collect those data directly from the electronic systems set up for the purpose of implementing this Regulation. The statistics should be anonymised and designed in such a way that it should not be possible to draw conclusions about specific dealers, even indirectly.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should compile the Member State data and publish them as part of an annual report by 31 October each year. The report should be made public and submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nBefore publication of the annual report, the Commission is to consult the Firearms Imports and Exports Coordination Group to verify that no commercially sensitive information was added to the draft report.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nAn electronic licensing system should be established to digitalise the procedures set out in this Regulation. It is important that a person entitled to request an authorisation be registered in that system before starting the application procedure. As the electronic licensing system is the technical basis for the implementation of this Regulation, it should be fully functioning as soon as possible.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nWhere Member States maintain their existing national electronic authorisation systems, the electronic licensing system established by this Regulation should be able to interconnect with those national electronic authorisation systems. Such interconnection should ensure the transfer of information on authorisations granted through the national electronic authorisation systems to the electronic licensing system.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nThe overall enforcement of this Regulation should be facilitated by the interconnection between the electronic licensing system established by this Regulation and the European Union Single Window Environment for Customs established by Regulation (EU) 2022/2399 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23) (the ‘EU Single Window Environment for Customs’). For that purpose and in accordance with Article 5(6) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2399, the Commission should amend Part A of the Annex to that Regulation. When goods are temporarily imported or exported using an ATA Carnet, set out in Appendix I to Annex A to the Convention relating to temporary admission (Istanbul Convention) (24), the competent authorities should receive information on the use of the ATA Carnet. Although that information cannot be exchanged automatically, insofar as the digital ATA Carnet is not applied by all contracting parties, further automation should be explored based on potential interoperability with the electronic system for the administration of ATA carnets, the e-ATA-system.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that this Regulation is properly applied, Member States should take measures giving the competent authorities appropriate powers.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nCompliance with the UN Firearms Protocol also requires that illicit manufacture of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition be established as criminal offences, and that measures be taken to enable the confiscation of items so manufactured or trafficked.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nThe whistle-blower-protection regime put in place by Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) should also apply to persons who report breaches of rules linked to imports and exports of firearms.\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to establish the Union general import authorisation and the Union general export authorisation for authorised economic operators for security and safety by specifying the format, use and geographical validity of those types of authorisations, to determine the part of the ATA carnet where the reference to the authorisation is to be indicated, to maintain the list of firearms, essential components, ammunition and alarm and signal weapons for which an authorisation is required under this Regulation, and to align Annex I to this Regulation to Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (26) and to Annex I to Directive (EU) 2021/555, as well as to adapt Annexes II, III and IV to this Regulation to the digitalisation and changes in customs procedures, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (27). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28).\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission and the Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of technical characteristics of semi-finished firearms, semi-finished essential components, and sound moderators, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nIn the case of national quantitative restrictions, authorisations granted by the Commission affect the territory only of a certain Member State. Therefore, considering the limited geographical scope of the restriction, as well as Article 2(3) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, it is justified that the Commission grant such authorisations by means of an implementing act in accordance with the advisory procedure set out in Article 4 of that Regulation.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should not prevent Member States from applying their constitutional rules relating to public access to official documents, taking into account Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (29).\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of improving traceability, and thus the security of trade in firearms, without thereby unduly hampering such trade, to lay down rules on authorisations for the import, export and transit of civilian firearms. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS

The role of reinsurance undertakings in the economy, their interconnectedness with primary insurance undertakings and financial markets more broadly, as well as the relatively concentrated reinsurance market require an appropriate framework to deal with their distress or failure in an orderly fashion. The recovery and resolution of both primary insurance undertakings and reinsurance undertakings should therefore be addressed, taking into account their respective specificities.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 exposed the vulnerabilities of the financial sector and its interconnectedness. Causes of distress and failure appeared to be linked to, inter alia, the evolution of financial markets and the intrinsic nature of insurance or reinsurance activities. In that regard, underwriting risks, that is under-provisioned claims, mispricing, that is underestimated premiums, asset-liability mismanagement and investment losses are often referred to as main sources of concern for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. In that context, taxpayer money has been used to restore the deteriorated financial conditions of several insurance undertakings. Although Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) aimed at strengthening the financial system in the Union and the resilience of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, it did not completely eliminate the possibility of failures of such insurance and reinsurance undertakings. High market volatilities and prolonged low levels of interest rates could be particularly harmful for the profitability and solvency position of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. The sensitivity of insurance and reinsurance undertakings to market and economic developments therefore calls for particular caution and an adequate framework to manage, including in a pre-emptive manner, potential deteriorations of the financial position of such undertakings. Some recent failures and near-failures, in particular of a cross-border nature, illustrated weaknesses of the current framework that need to be addressed to organise adequately the orderly exit from the market of insurance or reinsurance undertakings.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nActivities, services or operations performed by insurance or reinsurance undertakings that cannot be substituted easily within a reasonable timeframe, or at a reasonable cost for policy holders, beneficiaries or injured parties, need to be seen as critical functions that need to be continued. Such activities, services or operations can be critical at Union, national or regional level. The continuity of insurance or reinsurance protection is often preferable to the winding down of a failing undertaking as such continuity delivers the most favourable outcome for policy holders, beneficiaries or injured parties. It is therefore crucial that adequate tools be available to prevent failures and, where failures occur, to minimise negative repercussions by preserving the continuity of those critical functions.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nEnsuring effective resolution of failing insurance and reinsurance undertakings within the Union is an essential element in the completion of the internal market. The failure of such undertakings has an impact not only on policy holders and possibly the real economy and financial stability of the markets on which those insurance and reinsurance undertakings operate directly, but also on the trust in the internal market for insurance. The completion of the internal market in financial services has reinforced the interplay between the different national financial systems. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are active on financial markets to manage their investment portfolio and the risks related to their activities. In that context, the inability of Member States to address the failure of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking and resolve it in a way that is predictable and harmonised and would effectively prevent broader systemic damage, can undermine the stability of financial markets and, consequently, the internal market in the field of financial services.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 highlighted the need to develop an appropriate recovery and resolution framework for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. At international level, the Financial Stability Board published in October 2011, and updated in October 2014, the document ‘Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions’, encompassing considerations on the resolution of any insurance undertaking that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails. In June 2016, the Financial Stability Board released complementary guidance on developing effective resolution strategies and plans for systemically important insurers. In parallel, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors adopted in November 2019 ‘Insurance Core Principles’ for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings, a ‘Common Framework for Internationally Active Insurance Groups’ detailing standards for pre-emptive recovery planning, and actions that authorities are expected to take towards an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that would exit the market and enter into resolution. Those developments should be taken into account when laying down a framework for the recovery and resolution of failing insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nMany insurance and reinsurance undertakings are operating beyond national borders. A lack of coordination and cooperation between public authorities to prepare for and manage the distress or failure of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking operating across borders would undermine Member States’ mutual trust, result in a suboptimal outcome for policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties and affect the credibility of the internal market for insurance.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nThere is currently no harmonisation of the procedures at Union level for resolving insurance or reinsurance undertakings in a coordinated manner. Instead, considerable substantive and procedural differences between national laws, regulations and administrative provisions that govern the failure of insurance and reinsurance undertakings are observed across Member States. In addition, corporate insolvency procedures might not always be appropriate for insurance or reinsurance undertakings, as those procedures might not always ensure an adequate continuation of the critical functions for the benefit of policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, the real economy or financial stability as a whole.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to ensure the continuity of the critical functions of failing insurance or reinsurance undertakings, or of insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are likely to fail, while minimising the impact of such an undertaking’s failure on the economy or the financial system. It is therefore necessary to lay down a framework to provide authorities with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are failing or likely to fail. Such framework should ensure that shareholders bear losses first and that creditors bear losses after shareholders, provided that no creditor incurs greater losses than they would have incurred if the insurance or reinsurance undertaking had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings in accordance with the principle that no creditor should be worse off than under normal insolvency proceedings (the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle). In order to ensure that the treatment that affected shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors would have received if the undertaking under resolution had entered into normal insolvency proceedings is accurately reflected, all the relevant occurrences that would be triggered either by or before the opening of normal insolvency proceedings as well as all the relevant occurrences related to the opening of such proceedings, including those linked to the protection of injured parties under Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) in respect of damage resulting from accidents in the case of the insolvency of an insurance undertaking, should be taken into account.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nBuilding on Directive 2009/138/EC, the framework to be laid down should enable authorities to ensure the continuity of insurance protection for policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, transfer viable activities and portfolios of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking where appropriate, and apportion losses in a manner that is fair and predictable. Those objectives should help avoid unnecessary losses or social hardship falling on policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, mitigate negative impacts on the real economy, minimise negative effects on financial markets and minimise the costs for taxpayers.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nThe review of Directive 2009/138/EC, and in particular the introduction of more risk-sensitive capital requirements, strengthened supervision, enhanced liquidity monitoring and better tools for macro-prudential policies, should further reduce the likelihood of failures of insurance or reinsurance undertakings and enhance the resilience of those undertakings to economic stress, whether caused by systemic disturbances or by events specific to the individual undertaking. Nevertheless, despite a sound and robust prudential framework, situations of financial distress cannot be completely excluded. Member States should therefore be prepared and have adequate recovery and resolution tools in place to handle situations involving both systemic crises and failures of individual undertakings. Such tools should include mechanisms that enable authorities to deal effectively with undertakings that are failing or likely to fail. The use of such tools and the exercise of such powers should take into account the circumstances in which the failure occurs.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nSome Member States have already introduced pre-emptive recovery planning requirements, and mechanisms to resolve failing insurance or reinsurance undertakings. However, the absence of common conditions, powers and processes for the recovery and resolution of insurance or reinsurance undertakings across the Union is likely to constitute a barrier to the smooth operation of the internal market and hinder cooperation between national authorities when dealing with distressed or failing cross-border groups of undertakings. That is particularly true where different approaches mean that national authorities do not have the same level of control or the same ability to resolve insurance or reinsurance undertakings. Those differences in recovery and resolution regimes might affect the level playing field and potentially create distortions of competition between undertakings. That barrier should be eliminated and rules should be adopted to ensure that the internal market is not undermined. To that end, rules governing the pre-emptive recovery and resolution of insurance or reinsurance undertakings should be made subject to common minimum harmonisation rules. In order to ensure consistency with existing Union legislation in the area of insurance services, the pre-emptive recovery and resolution regime should apply to insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are subject to the prudential requirements laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nThe failure of an entity affiliated to a group can rapidly impact the solvency and the operations of the whole group. It is therefore necessary to have in place group pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning requirements. In addition, authorities should possess effective means of action with respect to those entities to impose remedial actions that take into account the financial soundness of all group entities, address impediments to resolvability in a group context and produce a consistent resolution scheme for the group as a whole, in particular in a cross-border context. The pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning and resolvability requirements and the resolution regime should therefore also apply to parent undertakings, holding companies and other group entities, including branches of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are established outside the Union.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that recovery and resolution planning and actual resolution of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are part of financial conglomerates or insurance groups that are themselves financial conglomerates or are parts of financial conglomerates can occur smoothly, and with the objective of reducing the administrative burden, information-sharing obligations between insurance and banking resolution and supervisory authorities should be established and the banking resolution authority should be granted the status of observer in the insurance resolution college for an insurance group that is, or is part of, a financial conglomerate in accordance with Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), and vice versa.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nWith the new rules introduced by this Directive, insurance and reinsurance resolution authorities, and banking resolution authorities, will each have their own framework for resolution that is adapted to the specificities of the insurance and reinsurance sectors as well as the banking sector. The timescale of a resolution in an insurance and reinsurance context is different from a resolution in a banking context. In order to prevent a bank run, the Single Resolution Board and national banking resolution authorities typically need to act swiftly. Insurance and reinsurance resolution authorities, on the other hand, often have the benefit of having more time to find the proper solutions that are most beneficial for policy holders. An event similar to a bank run is less likely to happen in the insurance and reinsurance sector, and the consequences of such an event would be different than in the banking sector.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nBoth sectoral legislative frameworks have created independent decision-making powers for the respective authorities. Consequently, the insurance and reinsurance and banking resolution authorities should act on an equal footing. For the performance of the resolution tasks, it is paramount that the insurance and reinsurance and banking resolution authorities inform one another and cooperate in good faith. The information-sharing requirements prescribed by this Directive should facilitate that cooperation. Therefore, the insurance and reinsurance and banking resolution authorities as well as the respective insurance and reinsurance and banking supervisory authorities should, without delay, exchange information considered necessary for the performance of their respective tasks.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that resolution authorities are kept informed and consulted sufficiently early in the process and in a structured way which allows them to exercise their mandate in an informed and consistent way, insurance and reinsurance and banking resolution authorities should be invited as observers to each other’s resolution colleges. This is particularly important in the context of pre-emptive recovery planning and resolution planning as well as for the assessment of whether the conditions for resolution are met and, finally, when taking resolution actions in relation to one or more entities that are part of financial conglomerates. To build on the experience gained, the Commission should review the relevant provisions of this Directive by five years after its entry into force.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to ensure the suitability and effectiveness of the recovery and resolution framework while avoiding unnecessary administrative burdens and costs on undertakings and authorities. The implementation of such recovery and resolution framework should therefore be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the undertaking concerned, and of its activities and services. In addition, the differences between recovery on the one hand and resolution on the other, should be taken into account. Regarding the scope of the recovery and resolution planning requirements, authorities should determine, on the basis of sets of risk-based criteria, which undertakings are subject to the fully-fledged or simplified planning requirements. To foster trust in the insurance and reinsurance single market and to foster a level playing field, a minimum degree of preparedness should be achieved through laying down a minimum market coverage level for the life insurance and reinsurance market and for the non-life insurance and reinsurance market. Regarding the scope of the resolution planning requirements, authorities should determine for which undertakings it is more likely relative to other undertakings under their remit that resolution action would be in the public interest in the event of failure or which undertakings carry out critical functions.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nFor the same reason, authorities should, where appropriate, apply different or reduced pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning and information requirements on an undertaking-specific basis, and require updates at a lower frequency. Authorities should, when applying such simplified obligations, take into account the nature, size, complexity and substitutability of an undertaking’s business, its shareholding structure and legal form, its risk profile and its degree of interconnectedness to other regulated undertakings or to the financial system in general. Authorities should also take into account whether the failure and subsequent winding-up of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a significant negative effect on policy holders, financial markets, other undertakings, or the wider economy. Authorities should report to the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) (EIOPA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), on the application of such simplified obligations on an annual basis.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nFor an orderly resolution process, and to avoid conflicts of interest, Member States should appoint public administrative authorities or authorities entrusted with public administrative powers to perform the functions and tasks in relation to the recovery and resolution framework. Member States should ensure that adequate resources are allocated to those resolution authorities. Where a Member State designates a resolution authority that has other functions, adequate structural arrangements should be put in place to separate those functions from the functions related to resolution and to ensure operational independence. Such separation should not prevent the resolution function from having access to any information it requires for the exercise of its duties under the recovery and resolution framework, or for cooperation between different authorities involved in the application of the recovery and resolution framework.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nIn light of the consequences that the failure of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking could have on policy holders, the financial system and the economy of a Member State, and in light of the possible need to use public funds to deal with such failure, the ministries of finance or other relevant ministries in the Member States should be closely involved, at an early stage, in the process of crisis management and resolution.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nIt is essential that groups, or where applicable, individual undertakings, prepare and regularly update pre-emptive recovery plans that set out actions to be taken by those groups or undertakings to restore their financial position following a significant deterioration of that position that could pose a risk to their viability. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should therefore identify a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators that would trigger the activation of remedial actions envisaged in such pre-emptive recovery plans. Such indicators should help insurance and reinsurance undertakings to take remedial actions in the best interest of their policy holders in line with the undertakings’ risk management systems and should not lay down new regulatory prudential requirements. This Directive should, therefore, neither preclude undertakings from including in their pre-emptive recovery plans nor require undertakings to include in their pre-emptive recovery plans points of deterioration of the capital position that would precede non-compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, of Directive 2009/138/EC. Pre-emptive recovery plans covering all material legal entities within the group should be detailed and should be based on realistic assumptions that are applicable in a range of robust and severe scenarios. Those pre-emptive recovery plans should be an integral part of an undertaking’s system of governance. Existing tools may be taken into account when preparing such pre-emptive recovery plans, including the own risk and solvency assessment, contingency plans or liquidity risk management plans. The requirement to prepare a pre-emptive recovery plan should, however, be applied proportionately and should be without prejudice to the development and submission of a realistic recovery plan as required by Article 138(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC. Where relevant, the elements of the pre-emptive recovery plan could inform or serve as a basis to develop the recovery plan required by Article 138(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to ensure an adequate degree of preparedness for crisis situations. Ultimate parent undertakings or individual insurance or reinsurance undertakings should therefore be required to submit their pre-emptive recovery plans to supervisory authorities for a complete assessment, including the assessment of whether those plans are comprehensive and could feasibly restore an undertaking or group’s viability in a timely manner, even in periods of severe financial stress. Where an undertaking presents a pre-emptive recovery plan that is not adequate, supervisory authorities should be empowered to require that undertaking to take measures necessary to redress the material deficiencies of the plan.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nResolution planning is an essential component of an effective resolution process. Resolution authorities should therefore have all the information necessary to identify critical functions and ensure their continuation. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings have privileged knowledge of their own functioning and any problems arising from it, and resolution authorities should therefore draw up resolution plans on the basis of, inter alia, the information provided by the undertakings concerned. In order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens, resolution authorities should primarily retrieve the necessary information from the supervisory authorities.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nSmall and non-complex undertakings should not be obliged to draw up separate pre-emptive recovery plans, nor should they be subject to resolution planning, except where such an undertaking represents a particular risk at national or regional level.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to anticipate the possible interaction of remedial and resolution measures and to enhance the crisis preparedness and the resolvability of groups, any group treatment for pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning should apply to all group entities subject to group supervision. The pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans should take into account the financial, technical and business structure of the group concerned and its degree of internal interconnectedness.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nGroup pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans should be prepared for the group as a whole and should identify measures in relation to both an ultimate parent undertaking and individual subsidiary undertakings that are part of that group. The extent to which subsidiary undertakings are considered in the group pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans should, however, be proportionate to their relevance to the group and to policy holders, the real economy and the financial system in the Member States where those subsidiary undertakings operate. The resolution authorities of the Member States where a group has subsidiary undertakings should be involved in the drawing up of any resolution plans. The authorities concerned, acting within the supervisory or resolution colleges, should make every effort to reach a joint decision on the assessment and adoption of those plans. However, adequate crisis preparedness should not be affected by an absence of a joint decision within the supervisory or resolution colleges. In such cases, each supervisory authority responsible for a subsidiary undertaking should be able to require a pre-emptive recovery plan for the subsidiary undertakings under its jurisdiction and make its own assessment of the pre-emptive recovery plan. For the same reasons, each resolution authority responsible for a subsidiary undertaking should, for the subsidiary undertakings under its jurisdiction, draw up and keep updated a resolution plan. The drawing up of individual pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans for undertakings that are a part of a group should remain exceptional, duly justified and apply the same standards that are applied to comparable undertakings in the Member State concerned. Where individual pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans for undertakings that are a part of a group are prepared, the authorities concerned should aim to achieve, to the extent possible, consistency with pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans for the rest of the group.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nResolution authorities that do not disagree with a joint decision can reach a joint decision among themselves on a group resolution plan, as well as on the identification of substantive impediments and, where necessary, on the assessment of the measures proposed by the ultimate parent undertaking and the measures required by the authorities in order to address or remove the impediments.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to keep all authorities concerned fully and permanently informed, supervisory authorities should transmit any pre-emptive recovery plans and any changes thereto to the resolution authorities concerned and resolution authorities should transmit any resolution plans and any changes thereto to the supervisory authorities concerned.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nOn the basis of an assessment of the resolvability of insurance or reinsurance undertakings, resolution authorities should have the power to require, either directly or indirectly through the supervisory authority, that insurance or reinsurance undertakings change their structure and organisation. Resolution authorities should also be able to take necessary but proportionate measures to reduce or remove any substantive impediments to the application of resolution tools and to ensure the resolvability of the entities concerned. Resolution authorities should assess the resolvability of insurance or reinsurance undertakings at the level of those undertakings where it is expected that, in accordance with the group resolution plan, resolution actions would be taken. The resolution authorities’ ability to request changes to the structure and organisation of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, or to take measures to reduce or remove any material impediments to the application of resolution tools and to ensure the resolvability of the undertakings concerned, should not go beyond what is necessary to simplify the structure and operations of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking concerned in order to improve that undertaking’s resolvability.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nThe implementation of actions outlined in a pre-emptive recovery plan or a resolution plan might have effects on staff of insurance or reinsurance undertakings. Those plans should therefore contain procedures for informing and consulting employee representatives throughout the recovery and resolution processes where appropriate. Those procedures should take into account collective agreements, other arrangements provided for by social partners, and national and Union law on the involvement of trade unions and workers’ representatives in company restructuring processes.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nEffective recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance undertakings or group entities operating across the Union requires cooperation among supervisory authorities and resolution authorities within colleges of supervisors and resolution colleges at all stages of the process, from the preparation of pre-emptive recovery and resolution plans to the actual resolution of an undertaking. Where authorities disagree on decisions to be taken with regard to groups and undertakings, EIOPA should, as a last resort, play a mediation role.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nDuring the recovery and preventive phases, shareholders should retain full responsibility and control of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. They should no longer retain such a responsibility once the undertaking has been put under resolution. The resolution framework should therefore provide for a timely entry into resolution, that is before an insurance or reinsurance undertaking is balance sheet or cash flow insolvent, before all equity has been fully wiped out, or before the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is unable to comply with its payment obligations as they come due. Resolution should be initiated where a supervisory authority, after having consulted the resolution authority, or a resolution authority, after having consulted the supervisory authority, determines that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking is failing or likely to fail and alternative measures would not prevent such a failure within a reasonable timeframe. An insurance or reinsurance undertaking should be considered to be failing or likely to fail in any of the following circumstances: (i) where the undertaking breaches or is likely to be in breach of the Minimum Capital Requirement laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 5, of Directive 2009/138/EC and where there is no reasonable prospect of compliance being restored; (ii) where the undertaking no longer fulfils the conditions for authorisation or where the undertaking fails seriously to comply with its legal obligations under the laws and regulations to which it is subject or is likely to seriously fail to comply with its legal obligations under the laws and regulations to which it is subject in the near future in a way that would justify the withdrawal of the authorisation; (iii) where the assets of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking are or there are objective elements to support a determination that the assets of the undertaking will, in the near future, be less than its liabilities; (iv) where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts or other liabilities in the near future, including payments to policy holders or beneficiaries as they fall due; or (v) where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking requires extraordinary public financial support.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to provide for a clear delineation of responsibilities between supervisory and resolution authorities, it should be specified that, once resolution action has been taken by the resolution authority, it is the resolution authority that becomes ultimately responsible for the effective implementation of such resolution action. From that moment in time, the supervisory authority should therefore refrain from adopting any measures with respect to the undertaking under resolution without the prior agreement of the resolution authority. Similarly, the resolution authority should have the power to terminate, in the context of resolution action, any measure taken by the supervisory authority where the continuation of that measure would hinder the application of resolution tools.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nThe use of resolution tools and powers might disrupt the rights of shareholders and creditors of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. In particular, the power of the resolution authorities to transfer the shares or all or part of the assets of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking to a private purchaser without the consent of shareholders affects the property rights of shareholders. In addition, the power to decide which liabilities to transfer out of a failing undertaking to ensure the continuity of services and to avoid adverse effects on policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, the real economy or financial stability as a whole might affect the equal treatment of creditors. Any resolution tool should therefore be applied only to those insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are failing or likely to fail, and only where it is necessary and proportionate to pursue the resolution objectives in the general interest giving due consideration to the objective of protection of the collective interest of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants. The individual interest of a particular person or group should not prevail over the overall balance of the collective interest of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants of the undertaking concerned.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nIn particular, resolution tools should be applied only where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking cannot be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings without unduly affecting the protection of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants, destabilising the financial system or preventing the rapid transfer and continuation of critical functions and where there is no reasonable prospect for any alternative private solution, including any increase of capital by the existing shareholders or by any third party sufficient to restore the full viability of the entity without having effect on insurance or reinsurance claims. Insurance guarantee schemes applicable to an undertaking that meets the conditions for insolvency proceedings or resolution should be taken into account when determining if the application of resolution tools is necessary in the public interest. Any interference with the rights of shareholders and creditors that results from resolution action should be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). In particular, where creditors within the same class are treated differently in the context of resolution action, such distinctions should be justified in the public interest and be proportionate to the risks being addressed and should be neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of nationality.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nResolution authorities should have a certain degree of flexibility to balance the resolution objectives taking into account as appropriate the nature and circumstances of each case.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nWhen pursuing the resolution objectives, resolution authorities should assess the most appropriate way for minimising the costs of resolution. Minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support is a resolution objective, but the use of such support also constitutes a cost of resolution. Cost minimisation should not, however, be considered a separate resolution objective, but rather a principle by which resolution authorities should be guided when deciding how best to achieve the resolution objectives.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nWhen applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers, resolution authorities should take all appropriate measures to ensure that resolution action is taken in accordance with the principle that insurance and reinsurance claims are affected after shareholders and other creditors have borne their share of the losses. In addition, resolution authorities should ensure that the costs of the resolution of insurance or reinsurance undertakings are minimised and that creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nThe write-down or conversion of capital instruments, debt instruments and other eligible liabilities should provide for an internal loss-absorption mechanism. That mechanism, combined with transfer tools aimed at maintaining continuity of insurance coverage for the benefit of policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, should allow for the achievement of the resolution objectives and should limit to a great extent the impact of a failure of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking on policy holders. There could be extreme cases, however, where the resolution of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking requires the intervention of specific national schemes, in particular an insurance guarantee scheme or a resolution fund, to provide for complementary loss-absorbing and restructuring resources or, as a last resort, extraordinary public financing. The safeguards necessary to protect creditors should also reflect the existence of such specific national schemes, which in turn have to comply with the Union State aid framework. The write-down or conversion tool should be applied before the use of any extraordinary public financial support.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nInterference with property rights should not be disproportionate. Affected shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors of insurance and reinsurance undertakings should therefore not incur greater losses than they would have incurred if the insurance or reinsurance undertaking had been wound up at the time that the resolution decision was taken. That ‘no creditor worse off’ principle is a reflection of the fundamental right to property protected by Article 17 of the Charter. That right should be protected in the administrative resolution procedure by ensuring that any affected shareholder, policy holder, beneficiary, claimant or other creditor is not worse off than under normal insolvency proceedings. The valuation of the treatment that policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties would have received in such a case should include any payment that policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties would have received from insurance guarantee schemes, where applicable, and from compensation bodies under Directive 2009/103/EC. In the event of a partial transfer of assets and liabilities of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking under resolution to a private purchaser or to a bridge undertaking, the residual part of the undertaking under resolution should be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. Shareholders and creditors who are left in the winding-up proceedings of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking should be entitled to receive in payment of, or compensation for, their claims in the winding-up proceedings not less than what they would have recovered if the whole insurance or reinsurance undertaking had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nTo protect the rights of shareholders and creditors, including policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants, it is necessary to lay down clear obligations concerning the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the undertaking under resolution and concerning the valuation of the treatment that shareholders and creditors, including policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants, would have received if the undertaking had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. It is therefore necessary to lay down that, before any resolution action is taken, a fair and realistic valuation of the assets and liabilities of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is carried out. Such a valuation should be subject to a right of appeal. However, due to the nature of resolution action and its close link with the valuation, such appeal should only be possible where it is simultaneously directed against the resolution decision. In addition, it is necessary to lay down that, after resolution tools have been applied, a comparison is made between the treatment that shareholders and creditors, including policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants, have actually received and the treatment they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings. That ex post comparison should be challengeable apart from the resolution decision. Shareholders and creditors that have received less than the amount that they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings should be entitled to the payment of the difference.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nWhen resolution actions are taken, policy holders could retain some or all of the benefits provided in their contracts and would not necessarily have to conclude a new insurance contract. In cases where an undertaking is wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, a change of contract could entail replacement costs for policy holders. Especially for long term insurance contracts, market conditions and the policy holders’ own characteristics as well as additional costs such as brokerage and closing fees could lead to significant costs for policy holders having to replace their contracts. When estimating such replacement costs in the context of the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle, one has to assume that the conclusion of a new insurance contract with comparable cover available in the market against prevailing market rates takes place within a reasonable time from the date of resolution action.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nIt is important that losses be recognised upon the failure of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking. The valuation of assets and liabilities of failing insurance or reinsurance undertakings should be based on fair, prudent and realistic assumptions at the moment that resolution tools are applied. The value of liabilities should, however, not be affected in the valuation by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s financial state. Valuations for the purpose of informing the choice and the design of resolution actions should be consistent with the applicable prudential regulatory framework, but in the context of resolution targeted modifications to the principles underlying this framework could be made, in particular where the assumption that the undertaking will pursue its business as a going concern is not met. It should be possible, in exceptional cases of urgency, that resolution authorities make a rapid valuation of the assets or the liabilities of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. That valuation should be provisional and should apply until an independent valuation is carried out. EIOPA should establish a framework of principles to be used in conducting such valuations and should allow for different specific methodologies to be applied by resolution authorities and independent valuers, as appropriate.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nWhen taking resolution actions, resolution authorities should take into account and follow the measures provided for in the resolution plans unless resolution authorities assess, taking into account circumstances of the case, that resolution objectives will be achieved more effectively by taking actions that are not provided for in the resolution plans.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nResolution tools should be designed and suitable to counter a broad set of largely unpredictable scenarios, taking into account that there could be a difference between a single insurance or reinsurance undertaking in crisis and a broader systemic crisis. Resolution tools should therefore cover each of those scenarios, including the solvent run-off of the undertaking under resolution until its termination, the sale of the business or shares of the undertaking under resolution, the setting up of a bridge undertaking, the separation of assets and liabilities from the impaired or under-performing portfolios of the failing undertaking, and the write-down or conversion of capital instruments and other eligible liabilities of the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nIn specific cases, where certain group entities provide services to an undertaking under resolution which are essential for ensuring the continuity of insurance coverage, the resolution authority should have the power to ensure that the goods and services provided by such an essential service provider continue to be provided in cases where its financial position deteriorates as a result of the failing of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking within the same group and the use of such power is necessary to preserve the continuity of insurance coverage provided by other group entities. Those powers could include exercising resolution powers and applying resolution tools to the essential service provider.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nWhere resolution tools have been used to transfer insurance portfolios to a sound entity, which could be a private sector purchaser or a bridge undertaking, the residual part of the undertaking should be liquidated within an appropriate timeframe. The length of that timeframe should be based on the need for the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking to provide services or support to enable the private sector purchaser or bridge undertaking to carry out the activities or services acquired by virtue of that transfer.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nFinancing arrangements should be established in each Member State to compensate policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants of insurance and reinsurance undertakings authorised in that Member State. Financing arrangements should be available to satisfy claims of shareholders and other creditors under the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle if that is necessary to avoid reliance on public funds. Those claims should be calculated in accordance with the creditor hierarchy in normal insolvency proceedings in order to prevent shareholders or other creditors from being compensated before policy holders, beneficiaries or claimants are fully compensated. While directly absorbing the losses of an insurance company should be avoided, it should be possible to use such financing arrangements to finance other costs associated with the use of resolution tools as a last resort, to the extent necessary to achieve the resolution objectives and insofar as the resolution principles are fully respected. Member States should be able to decide that financing arrangements could be used to absorb losses of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants. In such a case, the failing undertaking would exit the market and all or part of the portfolios of insurance contracts would be transferred as part of the sale-of-business tool or to a bridge undertaking, or maintained in the undertaking under resolution if it is placed in solvent run-off. In any case, shareholders should have been written down before resolution financing arrangements could be used to absorb losses. Acknowledging the diversity in insurance markets, Member States should be given some flexibility in relation to the precise arrangements of external financing as long as the availability of sufficient liquidity to guarantee compensation within a reasonable timeframe is ensured. A Member State should impose a contribution obligation only to insurance and reinsurance undertakings authorised in that Member State and to Union branches of a third-country undertaking which are established in its territory.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nThe sale-of-business tool should enable resolution authorities to effect a sale of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking or parts of its business to one or more purchasers without the consent of shareholders. When applying the sale-of-business tool, authorities should make arrangements for the marketing of that insurance or reinsurance undertaking or part of its business in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory process, while maximising the sale price as much as possible. Where, for reasons of urgency, such a process is impossible, authorities should take steps to redress detrimental effects on competition and on the internal market.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nAny net proceeds from the transfer of assets or liabilities of the undertaking under resolution when applying the sale-of-business tool should benefit the undertaking left in the winding-up proceedings. Any net proceeds from the transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership issued by the undertaking under resolution when applying the sale-of-business tool should benefit the owners of those shares or other instruments of ownership, provided that policy holders and other creditors are compensated first, to the extent that their claims have been written down without being fully compensated. Proceeds should be calculated net of the costs arisen from the failure of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and from the resolution process.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nInformation concerning the marketing of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking and negotiations with potential acquirers prior to the application of the sale-of-business tool is likely to be sensitive and might pose risks to trust in the insurance market. It is therefore important to ensure that the disclosure to the public of such information, which is required by Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), can be delayed for the time necessary to plan and structure the resolution of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking concerned.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nA bridge undertaking is an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is wholly or partially owned by one or more public authorities or controlled by the resolution authority. The main purpose of a bridge undertaking is to ensure that critical functions continue to be provided to the policy holders of the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. A bridge undertaking should therefore be operated as a viable going concern and should be put back on the market as soon as conditions are appropriate, or be wound up if it is not viable.\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nThe asset and liability separation tool should enable authorities to transfer assets, rights or liabilities of an undertaking under resolution to a separate vehicle in order to remove, manage and wind down such assets, rights or liabilities. To prevent an undue competitive advantage for the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the asset and liability separation tool, the main purpose of which is to facilitate a portfolio transfer, should be used only in conjunction with other tools.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nAn effective resolution regime should ensure that insurance or reinsurance undertakings can be resolved in a way that minimises the negative impact of a failure on policy holders, taxpayers, the real economy and financial stability. The write-down or conversion should ensure that, before insurance and reinsurance claims are affected, shareholders and creditors of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking suffer losses first and bear an appropriate part of the costs arising from the failure of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking as soon as a resolution power is used. The write-down or conversion tool should thus give shareholders and creditors of insurance or reinsurance undertakings and, to a certain extent, policy holders, a stronger incentive to monitor the health of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking during normal circumstances.\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nIt is important to ensure that resolution authorities have the necessary flexibility, in a range of circumstances, to place the undertaking in resolution in a solvent run-off, to transfer its assets, rights and liabilities in the best conditions for policy holders, or to allocate remaining losses. It is therefore appropriate to lay down that resolution authorities should be able to apply the write-down or conversion tool both where the objective is to resolve the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking as an undertaking in solvent run-off, and where critical insurance services are transferred while the residual part of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking ceases to operate and is wound up. In that context, the restructuring of insurance liabilities might be warranted to ensure the continuation of a material portion of the insurance coverage and where that is deemed to be in the best interest of the policy holders.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nWhere there is a realistic prospect that the undertaking’s viability may be restored and policy holders are not suffering any losses in the resolution process, the write-down or conversion tool could be used to restore the undertaking under resolution to a going concern. In such case, the resolution through write-down or conversion should be accompanied by the replacement of the management, except where the retention of the management is appropriate and necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nIt is not appropriate to apply the write-down or conversion tool to claims insofar as they are secured, collateralised or otherwise guaranteed as such write-down or conversion could be ineffective or due to the potential negative impact of such write-down or conversion on financial stability. However, in order to ensure that the write-down or conversion tool is effective and achieves its objectives, it is desirable that it can be applied to as wide a range of the unsecured liabilities of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking as possible. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to exclude certain kinds of unsecured liabilities from the scope of application of the write-down or conversion tool. Thus, to ensure the continuity of critical functions, the write-down or conversion tool should not be applied to certain liabilities to employees of the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking or to commercial claims that relate to goods and services critical to the daily functioning of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. To honour pension entitlements and pension amounts owed or owing to pension trusts and pension trustees, the write-down or conversion tool should not be applied to a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s liabilities to a pension scheme. To reduce the risk of systemic contagion, the write-down or conversion tool should neither be applied to liabilities arising from a participation in payment systems which have a remaining maturity of less than seven days, or to liabilities to insurance or reinsurance undertakings, credit institutions and investment firms, with the exception of entities that are part of the same group, with an original maturity of less than seven days.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nThe protection of the collective interest of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants is one of the main objectives of resolution. Insurance and reinsurance claims should therefore only be subject to the application of the write-down or conversion tool as a last resort measure and resolution authorities should carefully consider the consequences of a potential write-down of insurance claims stemming from insurance contracts held by natural persons and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nResolution authorities should be able to exclude or partially exclude liabilities in a number of circumstances where it is not possible to write down or convert such liabilities within a reasonable timeframe, where the exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to achieve the resolution objectives, or where the application of the write-down or conversion tool would cause a destruction in value such that losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if those liabilities were not excluded. Where those exclusions are applied, the level of write-down or conversion of other eligible liabilities may be increased to take account of such exclusions, subject to the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle being respected. At the same time, Member States should not be required to finance resolution from their general budget.\n\n(60)\n\n\t\n\nWhen applying the write-down or conversion tool to insurance contracts, resolution authorities should take into account that the compulsory minimum coverage levels under applicable law are met after the contract has been restructured. This should not prevent the resolution authority from applying the write-down or conversion tool to insurance claims which arose before the date of the resolution action.\n\n(61)\n\n\t\n\nAs a rule, resolution authorities should apply the write-down or conversion tool in a way that respects the pari passu treatment of creditors and the statutory ranking of claims under applicable insolvency law. Losses should therefore first be absorbed by regulatory capital instruments and should be allocated to shareholders either through the cancellation or transfer of shares or through severe dilution. Where that is not sufficient, subordinated debt should be converted or written down. Senior liabilities should only be converted or written down where the subordinate debt has been converted or written down entirely. Challenging the reduction of the principal amount of the instrument or liability or its conversion resulting from the exercise of write-down or conversion powers should only be possible under the law of the Member State of the resolution authority that exercised the write-down or conversion powers.\n\n(62)\n\n\t\n\nExemptions of liabilities, inter alia for payment and settlement systems, employee or trade creditors, or preferential ranking, should equally apply in third countries and the Union. To ensure that liabilities can be written down or converted in third countries, it is necessary to lay down that contractual provisions governed by the law of third countries recognise that possibility. Such contractual terms should not be required for liabilities exempted from the application of the write-down or conversion tool, or where the law of the third country or a binding agreement concluded with that third country allow the resolution authority of the Member State concerned to apply the write-down or conversion tool.\n\n(63)\n\n\t\n\nShareholders and creditors should contribute, to the extent necessary, to the loss allocation mechanism of a failing undertaking. Therefore, Member States should ensure that Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital instruments fully absorb losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Accordingly, resolution authorities should be required to write down those instruments in full, or to convert them, where applicable, to Tier 1 instruments, at the point of non-viability and before any resolution action is taken. For that purpose, the point of non-viability should be understood as either the point at which the resolution authority concerned determines that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking meets the conditions for resolution, or the point at which the resolution authority concerned decides that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking would cease to be viable if those capital instruments were not written down or converted. Those requirements should be recognised in the terms governing the instrument, and in any prospectus or offering documents published or provided in connection with the instruments.\n\n(64)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure effective execution of resolution, resolution authorities should have all the necessary legal powers that, in different combinations, can be exercised when applying resolution tools. Those legal powers should include the power to transfer shares in, or assets, rights or liabilities of, a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking to another entity, including another undertaking or a bridge undertaking, the power to write down or cancel shares, or write-down or convert liabilities of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the power to replace the management and the power to impose a temporary moratorium on the payment of claims. Ancillary powers are needed, including the power to require continuity of essential services from other parts of a group.\n\n(65)\n\n\t\n\nIt is not necessary to prescribe the exact means through which the resolution authorities should intervene in the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Resolution authorities should have the choice between taking control through a direct intervention in the insurance or reinsurance undertaking or through executive order. They should decide according to the circumstances of the case.\n\n(66)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to lay down procedural requirements to ensure that resolution actions are properly notified and made public. Information obtained by resolution authorities and their professional advisers during the resolution process is, however, likely to be sensitive and should therefore be subject to an effective confidentiality regime before the resolution decision is made public. Any information provided in respect of a decision before it is taken, be it on whether the conditions for resolution are satisfied, on the use of a specific tool or of any action during the proceedings, must be presumed to have effects on the public and private interests concerned by the action. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms for maintaining the confidentiality of such information, including on the content and details of recovery and resolution plans and the result of any assessment carried out in that context.\n\n(67)\n\n\t\n\nExchanges of information between resolution authorities and tax authorities should not be prevented. Such exchanges should be in line with national law, and, where the information originates in another Member State, it should only be exchanged with the express consent of the relevant authority from which the information originates.\n\n(68)\n\n\t\n\nResolution authorities should have ancillary powers to ensure the effectiveness of the transfer of shares or debt instruments and assets, rights and liabilities to a third-party purchaser or a bridge undertaking. In particular, to facilitate a transfer of insurance or reinsurance claims without affecting the overall risk profile of the related portfolio and of the associated technical provisions and capital requirements, the economic benefits provided by reinsurance agreements should be preserved. Resolution authorities should therefore have the ability to transfer insurance or reinsurance claims together with their corresponding reinsurance rights. That ability should also include the power to remove third parties’ rights from the transferred instruments or assets, the power to enforce contracts and the power to provide for the continuity of arrangements vis-à-vis the recipient of the transferred assets and shares. The right of a party to terminate a contract with an undertaking under resolution, or a group entity thereof, for reasons other than the resolution of the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking should also remain unaffected. In addition, resolution authorities should have the ancillary power to require the residual insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is being wound up under normal insolvency proceedings to provide services that are necessary to enable the undertaking to which assets or shares have been transferred by virtue of the application of the sale-of-business tool or the bridge undertaking tool to operate its business.\n\n(69)\n\n\t\n\nAccording to Article 47 of the Charter, everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal. The decisions taken by resolution authorities should therefore be subject to a right of appeal.\n\n(70)\n\n\t\n\nCrisis management measures taken by resolution authorities may require complex economic assessments and a large margin of discretion. Resolution authorities are specifically equipped with the expertise needed for making such assessments and for determining the appropriate use of the margin of discretion. It is therefore important to ensure that the complex economic assessments made by resolution authorities in that context are used as a basis by national courts when reviewing the crisis management measures concerned. However, the complex nature of those assessments should not prevent national courts from examining whether the evidence relied on by the resolution authority is factually accurate, reliable and consistent, whether that evidence contains all relevant information which should be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn therefrom.\n\n(71)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to deal with situations of urgency, it is necessary to provide that the lodging of any appeal does not result in automatic suspension of the effects of the challenged decision and that the decision of the resolution authority is immediately enforceable with a presumption that its suspension would be against the public interest.\n\n(72)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to protect third parties that have acquired assets, rights and liabilities of the undertaking under resolution in good faith by virtue of the exercise of resolution powers by the authorities. It is equally necessary to ensure the stability of the financial markets. A right of appeal against a resolution decision should therefore not affect any subsequent administrative act or transaction concluded on the basis of an annulled decision. In such cases, remedies for a wrongful decision should be limited to the award of compensation for the damages suffered by the affected persons.\n\n(73)\n\n\t\n\nCrisis management measures may be required to be taken urgently due to serious financial stability risks in the Member State concerned and the Union. Any procedure under national law relating to the application for ex ante judicial approval of a crisis management measure and a court’s consideration of such an application should therefore be swift. Member States should ensure that the authority concerned can take its decision immediately after a court has given its approval. That possibility should be without prejudice to the right of interested parties to make an application to the court to set aside the decision. However, such possibility should only be granted for a limited period after the resolution authority has taken the crisis management measure in order not to unduly delay the application of the resolution decision.\n\n(74)\n\n\t\n\nEfficient resolution and the need to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction require that no normal insolvency proceedings for a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking be opened or continued while a resolution authority is exercising its resolution powers or applying resolution tools, except at the initiative of, or with the consent of, the resolution authority. It is therefore necessary to lay down that certain contractual obligations can be suspended for a limited period to enable resolution authorities to apply the resolution tools. That possibility should not, however, apply to obligations in relation to systems designated by a Member State as referred to in Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), including central counterparties. Directive 98/26/EC reduces the risk associated with participation in payment and securities settlement systems, in particular by reducing disruption in the event of the insolvency of a participant in such a system. It is necessary to ensure that those protections continue to apply in crisis situations and that appropriate certainty for operators of payment and securities systems and other market participants is maintained. A crisis prevention measure or a crisis management measure should therefore not, per se, be deemed to constitute insolvency proceedings within the meaning of Directive 98/26/EC, provided that the substantive obligations under the contracts concerned continue to be performed.\n\n(75)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to ensure that resolution authorities, when transferring assets and liabilities to a private sector purchaser or a bridge undertaking, have adequate time to identify contracts that need to be transferred. It should therefore be possible for resolution authorities to restrict counterparties’ rights to close out, accelerate or otherwise terminate financial contracts before the transfer is made. Such restrictions should allow resolution authorities to obtain a true picture of the balance sheet of the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking without the changes in value and scope that an extensive exercise of termination rights would entail, and should help to avoid creating market instability. Interference with the contractual rights of counterparties should however be restricted to the minimum extent necessary. Any restrictions on termination rights imposed by resolution authorities should therefore only apply in relation to crisis management measures or events directly linked to the application of such measures. Rights to terminate arising from any other default, including failure to pay or deliver margin, should thus remain.\n\n(76)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to preserve legitimate capital market arrangements in the event of a transfer of some, but not all, of the assets, rights and liabilities of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. It is therefore appropriate to lay down safeguards to prevent the splitting of linked liabilities or linked rights and contracts, including contracts with the same counterparty covered by security arrangements, title transfer financial collateral arrangements, set-off arrangements, close out netting agreements, and structured finance arrangements. Where such safeguards apply, resolution authorities should be bound to transfer all linked contracts within a protected arrangement, or leave them all with the residual failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Those safeguards should ensure that the regulatory capital treatment of exposures subject to a netting agreement for the purposes of Directive 2009/138/EC is not affected.\n\n(77)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to provide financial stability to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking a moratorium on surrender rights of policy holders should be introduced. Such a moratorium and the ensuing financial stability for the undertaking concerned should provide the resolution authorities with sufficient time to valuate those undertakings and to assess which resolution tools should be applied. Such a moratorium should also ensure equal treatment of policy holders, and thus avoid potential adverse financial impacts on policy holders that would not be among the first to surrender their policy. Because one of the objectives of resolution is the continuation of insurance cover, policy holders should continue to make any obligatory payments under the insurance or reinsurance contracts concerned, including in the case of annuities.\n\n(78)\n\n\t\n\nEnsuring that resolution authorities have the same resolution tools and powers at their disposal will facilitate coordinated action in the event of a failure of a cross-border group. Further action, however, is necessary to promote cooperation and prevent fragmented national responses. To agree to a group resolution scheme when resolving group entities, resolution authorities should therefore be required to consult each other and cooperate in resolution colleges. To provide for a forum for discussion and reaching such agreement, resolution colleges should be established around the core of the existing colleges of supervisors through the inclusion of resolution authorities and the involvement of competent ministries, EIOPA and, where appropriate, authorities responsible for the insurance guarantee schemes. Resolution colleges should not be decision-making bodies, but platforms facilitating decision-making by national authorities, while it should be for the national authorities concerned to take the joint decisions.\n\n(79)\n\n\t\n\nFollowing the regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis, the experience gained since that crisis, and the application of this Directive, the Commission, after having consulted EIOPA, should submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the appropriateness of minimum common standards for insurance guarantee schemes within the Union. That report should at least: assess the state of play of insurance guarantee schemes in Member States (coverage level, types of insurance covered, triggers); discuss policy options, including the different policy options, such as using insurance guarantee schemes to continue or to liquidate insurance policies, thereby taking due account of the differences in insurance products in various Member States; assess the necessity of introducing and, where appropriate, outline the steps necessary to introduce a minimum baseline for insurance guarantee schemes across the Union. The report should be accompanied by a legislative proposal where appropriate.\n\n(80)\n\n\t\n\nResolution of cross-border groups should strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need for procedures that take into account the criticality of the situation and allow for efficient, fair and timely solutions for the group as a whole and, on the other hand, the necessity to protect policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in all the Member States where the group operates. The different resolution authorities should therefore share their views in the resolution college and any resolution actions proposed by the group-level resolution authority should be prepared and discussed among different resolution authorities in the context of the group resolution plans. In order to facilitate swift and joint decisions wherever possible, resolution colleges should also take into account the views of the resolution authorities of all the Member States in which the group is active.\n\n(81)\n\n\t\n\nResolution actions by the group-level resolution authority should always take into account their impact on policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in the Member States where the group operates. Resolution authorities of the Member State in which a subsidiary undertaking is established should therefore be able to object, as a last resort and in duly justified cases, to the decisions of the group-level resolution authority where those resolution authorities are of the opinion that the resolution actions and measures are not appropriate, either because of the need to protect policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in that Member State, or because of obligations that comparable undertakings in that Member States are subject to.\n\n(82)\n\n\t\n\nGroup resolution schemes should facilitate coordinated resolution, which is more likely to deliver the best result for all undertakings of a group. Group-level resolution authorities should therefore propose group resolution schemes and submit those schemes to the resolution college. Resolution authorities that disagree with a group resolution scheme or decide to take independent resolution action should explain to the group-level resolution authority and other resolution authorities covered by the group resolution scheme the reasons for their disagreement and notify those reasons, together with details of any independent resolution action they intend to take. Any resolution authority that decides to depart from the group resolution scheme should duly consider the potential impact of such departure on policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in the Member States where the other resolution authorities are located and the potential effects of such departure on other parts of the group.\n\n(83)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure coordinated action at group level, resolution authorities should be invited to apply, within a group resolution scheme, the same tool to entities belonging to the group that meet the conditions for resolution. Group-level resolution authorities should thus have the power to apply the bridge undertaking tool at group level in order to stabilise a group as a whole and to transfer ownership of subsidiary undertakings to the bridge undertaking with a view to the onward sale of such subsidiary undertakings, either as a package or individually, when market conditions are appropriate. In addition, the group-level resolution authority should have the power to apply the write-down or conversion tool at parent level.\n\n(84)\n\n\t\n\nEffective resolution of internationally active insurance and reinsurance undertakings and groups requires cooperation between Member States and third-country resolution authorities. For that purpose, where it is justified by the situation at hand, EIOPA should be empowered to develop and enter into non-binding framework cooperation arrangements with authorities of third countries in accordance with Article 33 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010. For the same reason, national authorities should be permitted to conclude bilateral arrangements with third-country authorities in line with EIOPA’s framework cooperation agreements. The development of such bilateral arrangements should ensure effective planning, decision-making and coordination in respect of such internationally active insurance and reinsurance undertakings. In order to create a level playing field, such bilateral arrangements should be reciprocal, with resolution authorities recognising and enforcing each other’s proceedings, unless any exception that allows for rejection of recognition of third-country resolution proceedings applies.\n\n(85)\n\n\t\n\nCooperation between resolution authorities should take place both with regard to subsidiary undertakings of Union or third-country groups as with regard to branches of Union or third-country insurance or reinsurance undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings of third-country groups are undertakings established in the Union and are therefore fully subject to Union law, including the application of any resolution tools. It is necessary, however, that Member States retain the right to act in relation to branches of insurance and reinsurance undertakings having their head office in third countries, where the recognition and application of third-country resolution proceedings relating to a branch would endanger the real economy or financial stability in the Union, or where Union policy holders would not receive equal treatment with third-country policy holders. In those circumstances, Member States should have the right, after having consulted their resolution authorities, to refuse recognition of third-country resolution proceedings.\n\n(86)\n\n\t\n\nThe implementation of this Directive should not prevent the national insurance guarantee schemes from coexisting with the recovery and resolution framework, regardless of the source of financing of the national insurance guarantee schemes. The use of resolution tools and powers to an insurance or reinsurance undertaking should not prevent policy holders, beneficiaries and other claimants from being compensated through these national insurance guarantee schemes.\n\n(87)\n\n\t\n\nEIOPA should promote convergence of the practices of resolution authorities through guidelines that are issued in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010. More in particular, EIOPA should specify all of the following: (a) further details on the criteria concerning the application of simplified obligations for certain undertakings; (b) a range of scenarios for pre-emptive recovery plans and a minimum list of qualitative and quantitative indicators; (c) the criteria for the identification of critical functions; (d) further matters and criteria for the assessment of resolvability; (e) the details on the measures to address or remove impediments to resolvability and the circumstances in which each measure may be applied; and (f) how information should be provided in summary or collective form for the purposes of confidentiality requirements.\n\n(88)\n\n\t\n\nTechnical standards in financial services should facilitate consistent harmonisation and adequate protection of policy holders, investors and consumers across the Union. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it would be efficient and appropriate to entrust EIOPA with the development of draft regulatory and implementing technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission.\n\n(89)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should, where provided for in this Directive, adopt, by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU, draft regulatory technical standards developed by EIOPA in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to specify the following elements: (a) the criteria to subject an undertaking to pre-emptive recovery planning, the methods to be used when determining market shares for the purposes of recovery planning and the information to be contained in the pre-emptive recovery plans; (b) the content of resolution plans and the content of group resolution plans; (c) different elements on valuation, including the circumstances under which a person is deemed to be independent for the purposes of carrying out a valuation, the methodologies for assessing the value of the assets and liabilities in the context of resolution, the separation of different valuations, a methodology for calculating the buffer for additional losses to be included in provisional valuations, methodologies and principles on the valuation of liabilities arising from derivatives and the methodology for carrying out the valuation of difference in treatment; (d) the contents of the contractual terms to be included in financial contracts governed by third-country law; (e) the operational functioning of resolution colleges. The Commission should, where provided for in this Directive, adopt draft implementing technical standards developed by EIOPA by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU, in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to specify the procedures, content and a minimum set of standard forms and templates for the provision of information for the purposes of resolution plans and cooperation from the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\n\n(90)\n\n\t\n\nDirective 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) and Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), contain rules on the protection of shareholders and creditors of undertakings that fall within the scope of those Directives. In a situation where resolution authorities need to act rapidly, those rules might hinder effective resolution action and application of resolution tools and powers by resolution authorities. Derogations under Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and Regulation (EU) 2021/23 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should therefore be extended to actions taken in the context of the resolution of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. In order to guarantee the maximum degree of legal certainty for stakeholders, such derogations should be set out clearly, should be narrow, and should only be used in the public interest and when resolution triggers are met.\n\n(91)\n\n\t\n\nTo provide adequate information sharing and access to all concerned authorities, it is necessary to ensure that resolution authorities are represented in all relevant fora and that EIOPA benefits from the expertise necessary to carry out the tasks related to the recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 should be amended to designate resolution authorities as competent authorities as referred to in that Regulation. Such assimilation between resolution authorities and competent authorities is consistent with the functions attributed to EIOPA pursuant to Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to contribute and participate actively in the development and coordination of recovery and resolution plans.\n\n(92)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings, those who effectively control their business, and their administrative, management or supervisory body comply with their obligations in relation to the resolution of such undertakings. It is equally necessary to ensure that those undertakings, those who effectively control their business, and their administrative, management or supervisory body are subject to similar treatment across the Union. Member States should therefore be required to provide for administrative sanctions and other administrative measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Such administrative sanctions and other administrative measures should satisfy certain essential requirements in relation to addressees, criteria to be taken into account when applying an administrative sanction or other administrative measure, publication of administrative sanctions or other administrative measures, key penalising powers and levels of administrative fines. Subject to strict professional secrecy, EIOPA should maintain a central database of all administrative sanctions or other administrative measures and information on the appeals reported to it by supervisory authorities and resolution authorities.\n\n(93)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should not be required to lay down rules for administrative sanctions or other administrative measures for infringements of this Directive which are subject to national criminal law. However, the maintenance of criminal sanctions rather than administrative sanctions or other administrative measures for infringements should not reduce or otherwise affect the ability of resolution authorities and supervisory authorities to cooperate, access and exchange information in a timely manner with resolution authorities and supervisory authorities in other Member States, including after any referral of the infringements concerned to the competent judicial authorities for prosecution.\n\n(94)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely the harmonisation of the rules and processes for the resolution of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the effects of a failure of any undertaking in the whole Union, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n(95)\n\n\t\n\nWhen taking decisions or actions under this Directive, supervisory authorities and resolution authorities should always have due regard to the impact of their decisions and actions on policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in other Member States and should give consideration to the significance of any subsidiary undertaking or of cross-border activities for policy holders, the financial sector and the economy of the Member State where such a subsidiary undertaking is established or the activities are carried out, even in cases where the subsidiary undertaking or the cross-border activities concerned are of lesser importance for the group.\n\n(96)\n\n\t\n\nBy five years after the entry into force of this Directive, the Commission should, building on the experience gained and after having consulted EIOPA, evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to the Council in more detail and focusing on selected aspects of the application of this Directive,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\nTITLE I\n\nSUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE, DEFINITIONS AND DESIGNATION OF RESOLUTION AUTHORITIES\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter and scope\n\n1.   This Directive lays down rules and procedures relating to the recovery and resolution of the following entities:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ninsurance and reinsurance undertakings that are established in the Union and fall within the scope of Article 2 of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nparent insurance and reinsurance undertakings established in the Union;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\ninsurance holding companies and mixed financial holding companies that are established in the Union;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nparent insurance holding companies in a Member State and parent mixed financial holding companies in a Member State;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nUnion parent insurance holding companies and Union parent mixed financial holding companies;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nbranches of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are established in a third country and that fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles 75 to 80.\n\nThis Directive also lays down rules and procedures relating to essential service providers where the relevant insurance or reinsurance undertaking enters into resolution.\n\nResolution authorities and supervisory authorities shall, when establishing and applying the requirements laid down in this Directive and when applying the different tools at their disposal in relation to an entity as referred to in the first or second subparagraph, take account of the nature of the business of that entity, its shareholding structure, legal form, risk profile, size, legal status and interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general, and the scope and complexity of the entity’s activities.\n\n2.   Member States may adopt or maintain rules that are stricter or additional to those laid down in this Directive and in the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis of this Directive, provided that those rules are of general application and do not conflict with this Directive and with the delegated and implementing acts adopted on its basis.\n\nArticle 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\n‘resolution’ means the application of a resolution tool or of a tool referred to in Article 26(7) in order to achieve one or more of the resolution objectives referred to in Article 18(2);\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\n‘insurance undertaking’ means an insurance undertaking as defined in Article 13, point (1), of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\n‘reinsurance undertaking’ means a reinsurance undertaking as defined in Article 13, point (4), of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\n‘insurance holding company’ means an insurance holding company as defined in Article 212(1), point (f), of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\n‘mixed financial holding company’ means a mixed financial holding company as defined in Article 2, point (15), of Directive 2002/87/EC;\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\n‘parent insurance holding company in a Member State’ means an insurance holding company which is established in a Member State and which is not a subsidiary undertaking of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company authorised or set up in the same Member State;\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\n‘Union parent insurance holding company’ means a parent insurance holding company in a Member State which is not a subsidiary undertaking of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, another insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company authorised or set up in any Member State;\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\n‘parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State’ means a mixed financial holding company which is established in a Member State, and which is not itself a subsidiary undertaking of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, an insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company authorised or set up in that same Member State;\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\n‘Union parent mixed financial holding company’ means a parent mixed financial holding company

Indicators relating to the capital position shall as a minimum contain any breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\nMember States shall require that any breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement result in appropriate remedial action by the undertaking concerned in line with the pre-emptive recovery plan.\n\nMember States shall require that supervisory authorities ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings put in place appropriate arrangements for the regular monitoring of the indicators referred to in the first subparagraph.\n\n9.   An insurance or reinsurance undertaking that decides to take a remedial action contained in its pre-emptive recovery plan, or that decides to refrain from taking such remedial action even though an indicator as referred to in paragraph 8, first subparagraph, has been met, shall notify such decision to the supervisory authority without delay.\n\n10.   The administrative, management or supervisory body of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking as referred to in paragraph 1 shall assess and approve the pre-emptive recovery plan before submitting it to the supervisory authority for review.\n\n11.   EIOPA shall, by 29 January 2027, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to specify further:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nin cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board, the range of scenarios referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe qualitative and quantitative indicators referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article.\n\n12.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe criteria, in particular as regards cross-border activity, referred to in paragraph 2, first subparagraph;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe methods to be used when determining the market shares referred to in paragraph 2, second and third subparagraphs;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe information that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking is to include in the pre-emptive recovery plan, including the remedial actions referred to in paragraph 6, point (e), and their implementation.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2026.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 6\n\nReview and assessment by supervisory authorities of pre-emptive recovery plans\n\n1.   Supervisory authorities shall, within nine months of the submission of each pre-emptive recovery plan, review that plan and assess the extent to which it satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 5 and all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nwhether the implementation of the arrangements proposed in the plan is reasonably likely to maintain or restore within an appropriate timeframe the viability and financial position of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhether the plan and specific options within the plan are reasonably likely to be implemented quickly and effectively in situations of financial stress;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nwhether the plan and specific options within the plan are reasonably likely to avoid to the maximum extent possible any significant adverse effect on the financial system, including in scenarios which would lead other insurance and reinsurance undertakings to implement pre-emptive recovery plans within the same period.\n\n2.   Supervisory authorities shall provide resolution authorities with all pre-emptive recovery plans they have received. Resolution authorities may examine the pre-emptive recovery plan to identify any actions in the pre-emptive recovery plan which may adversely impact the resolvability of the insurance or reinsurance undertakings concerned and make recommendations to the supervisory authority with regard to those matters within the period set out in paragraph 1.\n\n3.   Where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking carries out significant cross-border activities, the home supervisory authority shall, upon the request of a host supervisory authority, provide the pre-emptive recovery plan to that host supervisory authority. The host supervisory authority may examine the pre-emptive recovery plan to identify any actions in the pre-emptive recovery plan which may adversely impact policy holders, the real economy or the financial stability in its Member State and make recommendations to the home supervisory authority with regard to those matters. The home supervisory authority shall provide a reasoned reply as to its decision to follow or not the recommendations. Where the home supervisory authority fails to properly take into account the recommendations of the host supervisory authority, the host supervisory authority may refer the matter to EIOPA in accordance with Article 31(2), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\n4.   Supervisory authorities that, after having assessed the pre-emptive recovery plan, conclude that there are material deficiencies in that plan or material impediments to its implementation shall notify the insurance or reinsurance undertaking concerned of the content of their assessment and require the undertaking concerned to submit, within two months, a revised plan demonstrating how those deficiencies or impediments are addressed. That period of two months may be extended by one month, upon request of the undertaking concerned, where the supervisory authority so agrees.\n\nBefore requiring an insurance or reinsurance undertaking to resubmit a pre-emptive recovery plan, the supervisory authority shall give the undertaking the opportunity to state its opinion on that requirement.\n\nA supervisory authority that finds that the deficiencies and impediments have not been adequately addressed in the revised plan may instruct the undertaking to make specific changes to the plan.\n\n5.   Where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking fails to submit a revised pre-emptive recovery plan, or where the supervisory authority comes to the conclusion that the revised pre-emptive recovery plan does not adequately remedy the deficiencies or impediments identified in its original assessment, and where it is not possible to adequately remedy the deficiencies or impediments through an instruction to make specific changes to the plan, the supervisory authority shall require the undertaking to identify within a reasonable timeframe changes the undertaking can make to its business in order to address the deficiencies in the pre-emptive recovery plan or impediments to the implementation of that plan.\n\nWhere the insurance or reinsurance undertaking fails to identify such changes within the timeframe set by the supervisory authority, or where the supervisory authority concludes that the actions proposed by the undertaking would not adequately address the deficiencies or impediments, the supervisory authority may take a reasoned decision to instruct the undertaking to take any measures that the supervisory authority considers to be necessary and proportionate, taking into account the seriousness of the deficiencies and impediments and the effect of the measures on the undertaking’s business.\n\nThis decision shall be notified in writing to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and shall be subject to a right of appeal.\n\nArticle 7\n\nGroup pre-emptive recovery plans\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the group supervisor has the power to require that the ultimate parent undertaking of a group draw up and submit to the group supervisor a group pre-emptive recovery plan.\n\nGroup pre-emptive recovery plans shall consist of a pre-emptive recovery plan for the group headed by the ultimate parent undertaking. The group pre-emptive recovery plan shall identify remedial actions that may be required to be implemented at the level of that ultimate parent undertaking and at the level of its individual subsidiary undertakings to restore their financial position where that position has significantly deteriorated.\n\nThe group supervisor shall impose the requirement referred to in the first subparagraph on the basis of the criteria referred to in Article 5(2) or (3), as applicable.\n\n2.   The group pre-emptive recovery plan shall contain remedial actions to achieve the stabilisation of the group, or of any insurance or reinsurance undertaking of the group, when the group or any of its insurance or reinsurance undertakings is in a situation of stress so as to address or remove the causes of the distress and restore the financial position of the group or the undertaking that is part of the group in question, at the same time taking into account the financial position of other group entities.\n\nThe group pre-emptive recovery plan shall contain arrangements to ensure the coordination and consistency of proportionate measures to be taken at the level of the group and the group entities.\n\n3.   The group pre-emptive recovery plan, and any plan drawn up for an individual subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertaking, shall be drawn up in accordance with Article 5(5) to (8), and shall be updated in accordance with Article 5(4).\n\nIn accordance with Article 5(8), third subparagraph, appropriate arrangements for the regular monitoring of the indicators shall be put in place.\n\nThe group pre-emptive recovery plan shall identify whether there are obstacles to the implementation of remedial actions within the group, including at the level of individual entities covered by the plan, and whether there are substantial practical or legal impediments to the prompt transfer of own funds or the repayment of liabilities or assets within the group.\n\n4.   Supervisory authorities may require subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertakings or the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (c) and (d), to draw up and submit pre-emptive recovery plans where no group pre-emptive recovery plan exists.\n\n5.   Where the supervisory authority concerned assesses that an entity is not sufficiently considered by the group pre-emptive recovery plan in light of the significance of the entity in question in the Member State concerned and in light of the obligations to which comparable undertakings in that Member State are subject, it may request the group supervisor, on the basis of a reasoned opinion, to require the ultimate parent undertaking, or insurance holding company heading the group, to submit a revised group pre-emptive recovery plan taking into account the concerns expressed by the supervisory authority concerned. Where a revised group pre-emptive recovery plan has been submitted and the supervisory authority concerned assesses that that revised plan does not sufficiently address its concerns, it may require the subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertakings or the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (c) and (d), concerned, to draw up and submit a pre-emptive recovery plan. In that case, the supervisory authority shall provide the group supervisor with a reasoned opinion for this assessment. Subsequently it shall provide the group supervisor with the pre-emptive recovery plan.\n\n6.   The group supervisor shall, provided that the confidentiality requirements laid down in Article 66 are complied with, transmit the group pre-emptive recovery plans to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nEIOPA;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe relevant supervisory authorities which are members of or participate in the college of supervisors as referred to in Article 248(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe group-level resolution authority;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authorities of the subsidiary undertakings;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the group is or is part of a financial conglomerate, the relevant resolution authority designated in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU and the competent authority as defined in Article 4(1), point (40), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n7.   The administrative, management or supervisory body of the entity drawing up the group pre-emptive recovery plan pursuant to paragraph 1 or the pre-emptive recovery plan pursuant to paragraph 4 or 5 shall assess and approve the plan concerned before submitting it to the group supervisor or to the supervisory authority, as appropriate, for review.\n\n8.   When drawing up pre-emptive recovery plans, a Union subsidiary undertaking may take into account any group plans on pre-emptive recovery drawn up by the third-country insurance or reinsurance undertakings or third-country parent undertaking of which it is a subsidiary undertaking, where applicable.\n\nArticle 8\n\nReview and assessment by the group supervisor of group pre-emptive recovery plans\n\n1.   The group supervisor shall, after having consulted the relevant supervisory authorities which are members of or participate in the college of supervisors as referred to in Article 248(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, review the group pre-emptive recovery plan and assess the extent to which it satisfies the requirements and criteria laid down in Article 7. That assessment shall be made in accordance with the procedure established in Article 6 and in this Article and within the period laid down in Article 6(1) and shall take into account the potential impact of the remedial actions on policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in all the Member States where the group operates.\n\n2.   The group supervisor shall endeavour to reach a joint decision, as referred to in Article 17 of this Directive, within the college of supervisors established in accordance with Article 248 of Directive 2009/138/EC, on:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe review and assessment of the group pre-emptive recovery plan;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhether a pre-emptive recovery plan on an individual basis is to be drawn up for insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are part of the group, in accordance with Article 7(4) or (5) of this Directive;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe application of the measures referred to in Article 6(4) and (5) of this Directive.\n\nSection 3\n\nResolution planning\n\nArticle 9\n\nResolution plans\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities, after having consulted the supervisory authority, draw up a resolution plan for each insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is not part of a group subject to resolution planning pursuant to Articles 10 and 11, and that meets the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article. The resolution plan shall provide for the resolution actions which the resolution authority may take where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking meets the conditions for resolution referred to in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3).\n\n2.   Resolution authorities shall draw up resolution plans for insurance and reinsurance undertakings for which they assess that it is more likely, when compared to other undertakings under their remit, that resolution action would be in the public interest as referred to in Article 19(5) in the event of the failure of the undertaking concerned, or for which the authorities assess that they perform a critical function. Those assessments shall take into account, as a minimum, the necessity to achieve resolution objectives and the undertaking’s size, business model, risk profile, interconnectedness, substitutability and in particular its cross-border activity.\n\nOn the basis of the assessments referred to in the first subparagraph, resolution authorities shall ensure that at least 40 % of the Member State’s life insurance and reinsurance market and 40 % of its non-life insurance and reinsurance market – the life market share being based on gross technical provisions and the non-life market share being based on gross written premiums – are subject to resolution planning. In the calculation of the market coverage level, the subsidiary undertakings of a group may be taken into account where those subsidiary undertakings are covered in the group resolution plan.\n\nSmall and non-complex undertakings shall not be subject to resolution planning requirements, except where the resolution authority considers that such an undertaking represents a particular risk at national or regional level.\n\n3.   Where the insurance or reinsurance undertaking concerned carries out significant cross-border activities, the home resolution authorities shall provide the draft resolution plan to the host supervisory or resolution authorities. The host supervisory or resolution authorities may examine the draft resolution plan to identify any actions in the draft resolution plan which may adversely impact policy holders, the real economy or the financial stability in their Member State and make recommendations to the home resolution authority with regard to those matters. The home resolution authority shall provide a reasoned reply as to its decision to follow or not the recommendations. Where the home resolution authority fails to properly take into account the recommendations of the host supervisory or resolution authority, the host supervisory or resolution authority may refer the matter to EIOPA in accordance with Article 31(2), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\n4.   When specifying the options for application of resolution tools and powers, resolution plans shall take into consideration relevant resolution scenarios, including the scenario where the failure of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is idiosyncratic and the scenario where it occurs at a time of broader financial instability or system-wide events.\n\nResolution plans shall not assume any extraordinary public financial support besides, where available, the use of insurance guarantee schemes or of any financing arrangements.\n\n5.   Resolution authorities shall review, and where necessary update, resolution plans at least every two years, and in any case:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nafter any material change to the legal or organisational structure of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, to its business, or to its financial position, that could have a material effect on the effectiveness of the plan or would otherwise necessitate a revision of the resolution plan;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhen a material change to the financial position of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking that could have a material effect on the effectiveness of the plan, or otherwise necessitate a revision of the resolution plan, becomes foreseeable.\n\nInsurance and reinsurance undertakings and supervisory authorities shall promptly communicate to the resolution authorities any event that necessitates a revision or update of the resolution plan.\n\n6.   Without prejudice to Article 4, resolution plans shall set out options for applying the resolution tools to, and exercising resolution powers with respect to, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Resolution plans shall contain, quantified whenever appropriate and possible, all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na summary of the key elements of the plan;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\na summary of the material changes to the undertaking that have occurred since the latest resolution-related information was filed;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\na demonstration of how critical functions and core business lines could be legally and economically separated, to the extent necessary, from other functions so as to ensure continuity upon the failure of the undertaking;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nan identification of those assets which would be expected to qualify as collateral;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nan estimation of the timeframe for executing each material aspect of the plan;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\na detailed description of the assessment of resolvability, including the assessment of feasibility and credibility of winding-up under normal insolvency proceedings, carried out in accordance with Article 13;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\na description of any measures required pursuant to Article 15 to address or remove impediments to resolvability identified as a result of the assessment carried out in accordance with Article 13;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nan explanation as to how the resolution options could be financed without the assumption of any extraordinary public financial support besides, where available, the use of insurance guarantee schemes or of any financing arrangements;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\na detailed description of the different resolution strategies that could be applied in light of the different possible scenarios and the applicable timescales;\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\na description of critical interdependencies;\n\n(k)\n\n\t\n\nan analysis of the impact of the resolution plan on the employees of the undertaking, including an assessment of any associated costs, and a description of envisaged procedures to consult staff during the resolution process, taking into account national systems for dialogue with social partners where applicable;\n\n(l)\n\n\t\n\na plan for communicating with the media and the public;\n\n(m)\n\n\t\n\na description of essential operations and systems for maintaining the continuous functioning of the undertaking’s operational processes;\n\n(n)\n\n\t\n\nwhere applicable, any opinion expressed by the undertaking in relation to the resolution plan.\n\nThe summary of the key elements of the plan shall be disclosed to the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\n\n7.   The resolution authority shall transmit the resolution plans and any changes thereto to the supervisory authorities concerned.\n\n8.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the contents of the resolution plan.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2026.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\n9.   EIOPA shall, by 29 January 2027, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to specify further the criteria for the identification of critical functions.\n\nArticle 10\n\nGroup resolution plans\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that group-level resolution authorities have the power to draw up group resolution plans for groups that are subject to resolution planning on the basis of the conditions laid down in Article 9(2).\n\n2.   The group resolution plan shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nset out the resolution actions that are to be taken in respect of each entity where measures will be necessary to ensure the continuity of critical functions;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nexamine the extent to which the resolution tools could be applied and the resolution powers exercised in a coordinated manner and identify any potential impediments to a coordinated resolution;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nwhere a group contains entities incorporated in third countries, identify appropriate arrangements for cooperation and coordination with the relevant authorities of those third countries and the implications for resolution within the Union;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nidentify measures, including the legal and economic separation of particular functions or business lines, that are necessary to facilitate group resolution, taking into account intra-group interdependencies;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nidentify available sources of funding to finance the group resolution actions and, where the use of insurance guarantee schemes or of any financing arrangement would be required, set out principles for sharing responsibility for that financing between sources of funding in different Member States, while not assuming any extraordinary public financial support;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\ncontain the elements laid down in Article 9(6).\n\n3.   The group-level resolution authority shall transmit group resolution plans and any changes thereto to the supervisory authorities concerned and, where the group is, or is part of, a financial conglomerate, to the relevant resolution authority designated in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU and the competent authority as defined in Article 4(1), point (40), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n4.   Resolution authorities may draw up resolution plans for subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertakings or the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (c) and (d), where no group resolution plan exists.\n\n5.   When drawing up resolution plans, the resolution authorities of Union subsidiary undertakings may take into account the resolution strategy pursued by the third-country authorities concerned for the groups for which those resolution authorities are responsible.\n\nIf the resolution authority considers such resolution strategy to be credible and feasible, it may appropriately reflect that resolution strategy and its possible consequences for the Union subsidiary undertaking concerned in its resolution plan. This shall not put at risk the achievement of resolution objectives referred to in Article 18.\n\n6.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the contents of group resolution plans, taking into account the diversity of business models of groups in the internal market.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2026.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 11\n\nRequirements and procedure for group resolution plans\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that ultimate parent undertakings submit to the group-level resolution authority the information that may be required under Article 12. That information shall concern the ultimate parent undertaking and to the extent required each of the group entities including the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (b) to (e).\n\nThe group-level resolution authority shall, provided that the confidentiality requirements laid down in this Directive are complied with, transmit the relevant information provided in accordance with this paragraph to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nEIOPA;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authorities which are members of the resolution college;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe relevant supervisory authorities which are members of or participate in the college of supervisors as referred to in Article 248(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that, in resolution colleges, group-level resolution authorities, acting jointly with the resolution authorities referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, point (b), and after having consulted the supervisory authorities concerned which are members of or participate in the college of supervisors as referred to in Article 248(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC, draw up and maintain group resolution plans. Group-level resolution authorities may, at their discretion, and subject to them meeting the confidentiality requirements laid down in Article 80 of this Directive, involve in the drawing up and maintenance of group resolution plans third-country resolution authorities of jurisdictions in which the group has established subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding companies, or significant branches as defined pursuant to Article 248(8) of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that group resolution plans are reviewed, and where appropriate updated, at least every two years, and in any case:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nafter any change to the legal or organisational structure, to the business, or to the financial position of the group including any group entity, that could have a material effect on or necessitate a change to the plan;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhen a material change to its financial position that could have a material effect on the effectiveness of the plan or otherwise necessitate a revision of the resolution plan, becomes foreseeable.\n\n4.   The adoption of the group resolution plan shall take the form of a joint decision, as referred to in Article 17, of the group-level resolution authority and the resolution authorities of the subsidiary insurance and reinsurance undertakings and of the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (b) to (e).\n\nArticle 12\n\nInformation for the purposes of resolution plans and cooperation of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to require insurance and reinsurance undertakings or the ultimate parent undertaking, as applicable, to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ncooperate as much as necessary in the drawing up of resolution plans or group resolution plans;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nprovide them, either directly or through the supervisory authority, with all of the information necessary to draw up and implement resolution plans or group resolution plans.\n\n2.   Supervisory authorities in the Member States concerned shall cooperate with resolution authorities to verify whether some or all of the information referred to in paragraph 1 is already available and shall provide that information to those resolution authorities. Resolution authorities shall obtain all such available information from supervisory authorities before requesting information from insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\n3.   EIOPA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify procedures and a minimum set of standard forms and templates for the provision of information under this Article, and to specify the content of such information.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2026.\n\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nResolvability\n\nArticle 13\n\nAssessment of resolvability\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities, after having consulted the supervisory authority, assess the extent to which insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are not part of a group are resolvable without the assumption of any extraordinary public financial support besides, where available and applicable, the use of insurance guarantee schemes or of any financing arrangements.\n\nAn insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall be deemed resolvable where it is feasible and credible for that undertaking to be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, or for the resolution authority to resolve that undertaking by applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers.\n\n2.   Where a resolution authority concludes that resolution action may be necessary in the public interest because winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would not meet the resolution objectives to the same extent, it shall proceed to the following consecutive stages:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nselect a preferred resolution action appropriate to achieve the resolution objectives given the structure and business model of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nassess whether it is feasible to apply the selected resolution action effectively within an appropriate timeframe and identify potential impediments to its implementation;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nassess the credibility of the selected resolution action, taking into consideration the likely impact of resolution on the financial systems or real economies of the Member States or the Union and the protection of the collective interest of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants, with a view to ensuring the continuity of critical functions carried out by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\n\n3.   Resolution authorities shall make the resolvability assessment referred to in paragraph 1 at the same time as, and for the purposes of, the drawing up and updating of the resolution plan in accordance with Article 9. When performing the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, resolution authorities shall, as a minimum, examine the resolvability dimensions specified in the Annex.\n\n4.   For the purposes of the assessment of resolvability, resolution authorities may request insurance or reinsurance undertakings to provide all necessary information.\n\n5.   EIOPA shall, by 29 January 2027, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to specify further matters and criteria for the assessment of the resolvability of insurance and reinsurance undertakings or groups provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article and in Article 14 of this Directive.\n\nArticle 14\n\nAssessment of resolvability for groups\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that group-level resolution authorities, together with the resolution authorities of subsidiary undertakings, after having consulted the group supervisor and the supervisory authorities of such subsidiary undertakings, assess the extent to which groups are resolvable without the assumption of any extraordinary public financial support besides, where available and applicable, the use of insurance guarantee schemes or of any financing arrangements.\n\n2.   A group shall be deemed resolvable where it is feasible and credible for the resolution authorities either to wind up group entities under normal insolvency proceedings or to resolve that group by applying resolution tools to, and exercising resolution powers with respect to, group entities where they can be easily separated in a timely manner, or by any other means provided for under national law.\n\nThe resolution colleges referred to in Article 70 shall take into account the assessment of group resolvability when discharging their functions.\n\n3.   Where a resolution authority concludes that resolution action may be necessary in the public interest because winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would not meet the resolution objectives to the same extent, it shall proceed to the following consecutive stages:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nselect preferred resolution actions appropriate to achieve the resolution objectives given the structure and business model of the group;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nassess whether it is feasible to apply the selected resolution action effectively within an appropriate timeframe and identify potential impediments to its implementation;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nassess the credibility of the selected resolution action, taking into consideration the likely impact of resolution on the financial systems or real economies of the Member States or the Union and the protection of the collective interest of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants, with a view to ensuring the continuity of critical functions carried out by the group.\n\n4.   Group-level resolution authorities shall make the resolvability assessment of groups at the same time as, and for the purposes of, the drawing up and updating of the group resolution plans in accordance with Article 10. The assessment shall be made under the decision-making procedure laid down in Article 11. When performing the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, group-level resolution authorities shall, as a minimum, examine the resolvability dimensions specified in the Annex.\n\n5.   For the purposes of the assessment of resolvability, the group-level resolution authority may request the group entities to provide all necessary information.\n\nArticle 15\n\nPower to address or remove impediments to resolvability\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, where the assessment carried out in accordance with Article 13 or 14 reveals that there are substantive impediments to the resolvability of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the resolution authority notifies that insurance or reinsurance undertaking and the supervisory authority concerned thereof in writing.\n\n2.   The requirement for resolution authorities to draw up resolution plans and for the relevant resolution authorities to reach a joint decision in accordance with Article 17 on group resolution plans referred to in Article 9(1) and Article 11(4) respectively shall be suspended following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article until the measures to remove the substantive impediments to resolvability have been accepted by the resolution authority pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article or decided upon pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.\n\n3.   Within four months of the date of receipt of a notification referred to in paragraph 1, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall propose to the resolution authority possible measures to address or remove the substantive impediments identified in the notification.\n\nThe timeline for the implementation of those measures proposed by the undertaking shall take into account the reasons for the substantive impediments.\n\nThe resolution authority, after having consulted the supervisory authority, shall assess whether those measures effectively address or remove the substantive impediments.\n\n4.   Resolution authorities that find that the measures proposed by an insurance or reinsurance undertaking in accordance with paragraph 3 do not effectively reduce or remove the impediment concerned, shall, either directly, or indirectly through the supervisory authority, require the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to take any of the alternative measures set out in paragraph 5, and notify such measures in writing to that undertaking, which shall propose a plan to comply with those requirements within one month of receiving such notification.\n\nWhen identifying alternative measures, resolution authorities shall demonstrate how the measures proposed by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking would not be able to remove the impediments to resolvability and how the alternative measures proposed are proportionate in removing those impediments. Resolution authorities shall take into account the effect of the measures on the business of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, its stability and its ability to contribute to the economy.\n\n5.   For the purposes of paragraph 4, resolution authorities shall have the power to take at least any of the following alternative measures:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to revise any intra-group financing agreements or review the absence thereof, or draw up service agreements, whether intra-group or with third parties;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to limit its maximum individual and aggregate exposures;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nimpose specific or regular additional information requirements relevant for resolution purposes;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to divest specific assets or to restructure liabilities;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to limit or cease specific existing or proposed activities;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nrestrict or prevent the development of new or existing business lines or sale of new or existing products;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to change the reinsurance strategy;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nrequire changes to legal or operational structures of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking or any group entity, either directly or indirectly under its control, so as to reduce complexity to ensure that critical functions may be legally and operationally separated from other functions through the application of the resolution tools;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the insurance or reinsurance undertaking or a parent undertaking to set up a parent insurance holding company in a Member State or a Union parent insurance holding company;\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is the subsidiary undertaking of a mixed-activity insurance holding company, require that the mixed-activity insurance holding company sets up a separate insurance holding company to control the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, where necessary to facilitate the resolution of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and to avoid that the application of resolution tools and the exercise of resolution powers has an adverse effect on the non-financial part of the group.\n\n6.   Before identifying any alternative measure referred to in paragraph 5, the resolution authority, after having consulted the supervisory authority, shall duly consider the potential effect of such measure on the soundness and stability of that particular insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s ongoing business and on the internal market.\n\n7.   A notification or decision made pursuant to paragraph 1 or 4 shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ncontain the reasons for the assessment or determination in question;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nbe subject to a right of appeal.\n\nMoreover, a decision made pursuant to paragraph 4 shall indicate how it complies with the requirement for proportionate application laid down in paragraph 4, second subparagraph.\n\n8.   EIOPA shall, by 29 July 2027, issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to specify further details on the measures provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article and the circumstances in which each measure may be applied.\n\nArticle 16\n\nPower to address or remove impediments to resolvability: group treatment\n\n1.   A group-level resolution authority, together with the resolution authorities of subsidiary undertakings, after having consulted the college of supervisors established in accordance with Article 248 of Directive 2009/138/EC, shall consider the assessment referred to in Article 14 within the resolution college and shall take all reasonable steps to reach a joint decision as referred to in Article 17 on the application of measures identified in accordance with Article 15(4) in relation to all relevant group entities.\n\n2.   The group-level resolution authority, in cooperation with the group supervisor and with EIOPA, in accordance with Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010, shall prepare a report and submit it to the ultimate parent undertaking and to the resolution authorities of subsidiaries, which shall provide that report to the subsidiary undertakings within their remit. The report shall be prepared after having consulted the supervisory authorities, and shall analyse the substantive impediments to the effective application of resolution tools and the effective exercise of resolution powers in relation to the group. The report shall recommend any proportionate and targeted measures that, in the view of the group-level resolution authority, are necessary or appropriate to remove those impediments, considering the impact of those measures on the group’s business model.\n\n3.   Within four months of the date of receipt of the report, the ultimate parent undertaking may submit observations and propose to the group-level resolution authority alternative measures to address or remove the impediments identified in the report.\n\nThe group-level resolution authority, after having consulted the group supervisor, shall assess whether those measures effectively address or remove the substantive impediments.\n\n4.   The group-level resolution authority shall communicate any measure proposed by the ultimate parent undertaking to the authorities that are members of or participate in the resolution college. The group-level resolution authority and the resolution authorities of the subsidiary undertakings, after having consulted the supervisory authorities, shall do everything within their power to reach a joint decision, as referred to in Article 17, within the resolution college regarding the identification of substantive impediments, and, where necessary, regarding the assessment of the measures proposed by the ultimate parent undertaking and the measures required by the authorities in order to address or remove the impediments. When doing so, they shall take into account the potential impact of the measures in all Member States where the group operates.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nJoint decisions\n\nArticle 17\n\nJoint decisions\n\n1.   Group supervisors, supervisory authorities, group-level resolution authorities and resolution authorities shall endeavour to reach the joint decisions referred to in Article 8(2), Article 11(4) and Article 16(4), as applicable, within four months of the date of:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe transmission by the group supervisor of the group pre-emptive recovery plan in accordance with Article 7(6);\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe transmission by the group-level resolution authority of the information referred to in the Article 11(1), second subparagraph;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe submission of any observations or the proposal of any alternative measures by the ultimate parent undertaking, or the expiry of the period referred to in Article 16(3), whichever is earlier.\n\nEIOPA may, at the request of a supervisory authority or a resolution authority, assist the group supervisors, supervisory authorities, group-level resolution authorities and resolution authorities in reaching a joint decision in accordance with Article 31(2), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\n2.   In the absence of a joint decision within the period referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, introductory wording, on any of the following matters, the group supervisor or the group-level resolution authority, as applicable, shall make its own decision thereon:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe review and assessment of the group pre-emptive recovery plan;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nany measures the ultimate parent undertaking is required to take in accordance with Article 6(4) and (5);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe group resolution plan;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe measures referred to in Article 16.\n\nThe decision made by the group supervisor or the group-level resolution authority, as applicable, shall be fully reasoned and shall take into account the views and reservations of other supervisory authorities or resolution authorities, as applicable, expressed during the period referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, introductory wording.

of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking are or there are objective elements to support a determination that the assets of the undertaking will, in the near future, be less than its liabilities;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe insurance or reinsurance undertaking is unable to pay its debts or other liabilities, including payments to policy holders or beneficiaries, as they fall due, or there

resolution objectives and the winding-up of the undertaking under normal insolvency proceedings, including with the use of insurance guarantee schemes applicable to that undertaking if the conditions for normal insolvency proceedings are met, would not meet those objectives to the same extent.\n\nArticle 20\n\nConditions for resolution with regard to parent undertakings and holding companies\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may take resolution action in relation to any of the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (b) to (e), where that entity

proceedings or analogous insolvency proceedings for the purposes of Article 5(1) of Council Directive 2001/23/EC (19).\n\n5.   When applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers, resolution authorities shall inform and consult employee representatives of the undertaking concerned where appropriate.\n\n6.   Resolution authorities shall apply resolution tools and exercise resolution powers without prejudice to provisions on the representation of employees in management bodies as provided for in national law or practice.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nValuation\n\nArticle 23\n\nValuation for the purposes of resolution\n\n1.   Resolution authorities shall ensure that any resolution action is taken on the basis of a valuation ensuring a fair, prudent and realistic assessment of the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of an entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e).\n\n2.   Before the resolution authority places an entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), under resolution, it shall ensure that a first valuation is carried out to determine whether the conditions for resolution under Article 19(1) or Article 20(3) are met.\n\n3.   After the resolution authority has decided to place an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), under resolution, it shall ensure that a second valuation is carried out to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ninform the decision on the appropriate resolution action to be taken;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nensure that any losses of that entity are

However, that valuation may, where appropriate, be adjusted to reflect that the assumption that the undertaking pursues its business as a going concern is not met, and to reflect the specific circumstances related to the use of resolution tools.\n\n5.   The valuations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 may be subject to an appeal in accordance with Article 67 only together with the decision to apply a resolution tool or to exercise a resolution power.\n\nArticle 24\n\nRequirements for valuation\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the valuations referred to in Article 23 are carried out by any of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na person independent from any public authority and from the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e);\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority, where those valuations cannot be carried out by a person as referred to in point (a).\n\n2.   The valuations referred to in Article 23 shall be considered definitive where they have been carried out by the person referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article and all the requirements laid down in paragraphs 3 to 5 of this Article are fulfilled.\n\n3.   Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, a definitive valuation shall be based on prudent assumptions and shall not assume any potential provision of extraordinary public financial support from the point in time at which resolution action is taken.\n\n4.   A definitive valuation shall be supplemented by the following information held by the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e):\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nan updated financial statement and an updated economic valuation, in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC, of the entity;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\na report on the financial position of the entity, including, where relevant, an evaluation by an independent actuarial function of the entity’s technical provisions referred to in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 2, of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nany additional information on the market and accounting values of the assets, technical provisions referred to in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 2, of Directive 2009/138/EC, and other liabilities of the entity.\n\n5.   A definitive valuation shall indicate the subdivision of the creditors in classes in accordance with their priority levels under the applicable insolvency law. The definitive valuation shall also contain an estimate of the treatment that each class of shareholders and creditors would have been expected to receive if the entity concerned were wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.\n\nThe estimate referred to in the first subparagraph shall not prejudice the valuation referred to in Article 56.\n\n6.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe circumstances in which a person is deemed to be independent from both the resolution authority and the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe methodologies for assessing the value of the assets and liabilities of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking in the context of resolution;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe separation of the valuations under Articles 23 and 56 of this Directive.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2027.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 25\n\nProvisional and definitive valuations\n\n1.   Valuations as referred to in Article 23 that do not meet the requirements laid down in Article 24(2) shall be considered provisional valuations.\n\nProvisional valuations shall contain a buffer for additional losses and an appropriate justification for that buffer.\n\n2.   Resolution authorities that take resolution action on the basis of a provisional valuation shall ensure that a definitive valuation is carried out as soon as possible.\n\nThose resolution authorities shall ensure that the definitive valuation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nallows for full recognition of any losses of the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), in its books;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\ninforms a decision to write back creditors’ claims or to increase the value of the consideration paid, in accordance with paragraph 3.\n\n3.   Where the definitive valuation’s estimate of the net asset value of the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), is higher than the provisional valuation’s estimate of the net asset value of that entity, the resolution authority may:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nincrease the value of the claims of affected creditors which have been written down or restructured;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nrequire a bridge undertaking to make a further payment of consideration in respect of the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations to the undertaking under resolution or, as the case may be, to the owners of the instruments of ownership.\n\n4.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the methodology for calculating the buffer for additional losses to be included in provisional valuations.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2027.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nResolution tools\n\nSection 1\n\nGeneral principles\n\nArticle 26\n\nGeneral principles on resolution tools\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the powers necessary to apply the resolution tools to an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), that meets the conditions for resolution referred to in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3).\n\n2.   Where a resolution authority decides to apply a resolution tool to an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), and that resolution action would result in losses being borne by creditors, in particular policy holders, or would result in their claims being restructured or converted, the resolution authority shall exercise the power to write down or convert capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 35 immediately before or together with the application of the resolution tool.\n\nAny proceeds, generated after recovery of any reasonable expenses properly incurred in connection with the use of the resolution tools or the exercising of resolution powers as a result of the application of any resolution tool in accordance with paragraph 5, shall first compensate the entity’s policy holders and other creditors to the extent that their claims have been written down without being fully compensated.\n\nThe conversion of eligible liabilities into capital instruments may be applied to insurance claims only in cases where the resolution authority justifies that the resolution objectives cannot be achieved through other resolution tools, or that the conversion of insurance claims would lead to better protection for policy holders compared to the use of any other resolution tool and the write-down of their claims.\n\n3.   The resolution tools are the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe solvent run-off tool;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe sale-of-business tool;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking tool;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe asset and liability separation tool;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe write-down or conversion tool.\n\nResolution authorities may apply the resolution tools individually or in any combination, except for the asset and liability separation tool, which shall be applied only in combination with another resolution tool.\n\n4.   Where only the sale-of-business tool and the bridge undertaking tool are used, and where those tools are used to transfer only part of the assets, rights or liabilities of the undertaking under resolution, the residual insurance or reinsurance undertaking or a residual entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (b) to (e), from which the assets, rights or liabilities have been transferred, shall be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. Such winding-up shall be done within a reasonable timeframe, having regard to any need for that residual insurance or reinsurance undertaking or residual entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (b) to (e), to provide services or support pursuant to Article 45 in order to enable the recipient to carry out the activities or services acquired by virtue of that transfer, and any other reason that the continuation of the residual insurance or reinsurance undertaking or a residual entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (b) to (e), is necessary to achieve the resolution objectives or comply with the principles laid down in Article 22.\n\n5.   The resolution authority and any financing arrangement acting pursuant to Article 81 or the resolution authority on behalf of any financing arrangement may recover any reasonable expenses properly incurred in connection with the application of the resolution tools or the exercising of the resolution powers in one or more of the following ways:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nas a deduction from any consideration paid by a recipient to the undertaking under resolution or, as the case may be, to the owners of the shares or other instruments of ownership;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nfrom the undertaking under resolution, as a preferred creditor;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nfrom any proceeds generated as a result of the termination of the activities of the bridge undertaking, the asset and liability management vehicle or the insurance or reinsurance undertaking in solvent run-off, as a preferred creditor.\n\n6.   Member States shall ensure that rules of national insolvency law on the voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to creditors do not apply to transfers of assets, rights or liabilities from an undertaking under resolution to another entity by virtue of the application of a resolution tool or the exercise of a resolution power.\n\n7.   Member States may confer upon resolution authorities additional tools and powers exercisable where an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), meets the conditions for resolution referred to in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3), provided that:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nwhen applied to a cross-border group, those additional tools and powers do not pose obstacles to effective group resolution; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthose tools and powers are consistent with the resolution objectives and the general principles governing resolution laid down in Article 22.\n\n8.   Member States shall ensure that, to the extent that any of the resolution tools is not applicable to an entity within the scope of Article 1(1) as a result of its specific legal form of mutual undertaking or cooperative society, resolution authorities have the powers necessary to apply tools which are as similar as possible to those listed in paragraph 3 of this Article, including in terms of their effects.\n\nSection 2\n\nThe solvent run-off tool\n\nArticle 27\n\nThe solvent run-off tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to place the undertaking under resolution in a solvent run-off procedure to terminate the activities of that undertaking, and to prohibit the undertaking under resolution to underwrite new insurance and reinsurance business.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that, in the event the authorisation has been withdrawn by the supervisory authority, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to which the solvent run-off tool has been applied meets the Minimum Capital Requirement laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 5, of Directive 2009/138/EC immediately following the application of that tool.\n\n3.   In the event of withdrawal of authorisation by the supervisory authority, Member States shall ensure that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking under the solvent run-off tool continues to be subject to the general rules and objectives of insurance supervision set out in Title I, Chapter III, of Directive 2009/138/EC, until termination of its activities in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article.\n\n4.   Resolution authorities shall ensure that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking under resolution in a solvent run-off is capable of retaining adequately trained and competent staff to ensure the orderly continuation of its insurance activities in run-off until its liquidation.\n\n5.   Resolution authorities shall monitor, in close cooperation with supervisory authorities, the cash flow, as well as the costs and expenses of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking under resolution to preserve its value and marketability.\n\n6.   Resolution authorities shall, in close cooperation with supervisory authorities, assess intended changes to the composition of assets, monitor closely reinsurance arrangements and require, at least on a quarterly basis, independent actuarial reviews of the technical provisions and reserves.\n\n7.   In application of the solvent run-off tool, resolution authorities may restrict or prohibit any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity, including dividend payments, and may restrict or prohibit any payments of variable remuneration and discretionary pension benefits.\n\n8.   Resolution authorities shall take a decision that an undertaking under resolution in solvent run-off has to be wound-up in any of the following cases, whichever occurs first:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nall or substantially all of the assets, rights or liabilities of the undertaking under resolution in solvent run-off are sold to a third-party purchaser;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe assets of the undertaking under resolution in solvent run-off are completely wound down and its liabilities are completely discharged.\n\n9.   Where the solvent run-off tool is used and where the net asset value of the undertaking under resolution in solvent run-off has become negative, the resolution authority shall assess whether to wind up the undertaking under normal insolvency proceedings or to apply another resolution tool.\n\nIn the event the Minimum Capital Requirement laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 5, of Directive 2009/138/EC is not met, the resolution authority shall assess, in close cooperation with the supervisory authority, whether the undertaking should be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, or another resolution tool should be applied.\n\nSection 3\n\nThe asset and liability separation tool, the sale-of-business tool and the bridge undertaking tool\n\nArticle 28\n\nPrinciples for the application of the asset and liability separation tool, the sale-of-business tool and the bridge undertaking tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, subject to Article 31(5) and (6), and Article 67, resolution authorities have the power to use the asset and liability separation tool, the sale-of-business tool and the bridge undertaking tool without obtaining the consent of the shareholders of the undertaking under resolution or any third party, other than the purchaser or the bridge undertaking, and without complying with any procedural requirements under company or securities law, other than those laid down in Article 29.\n\n2.   Subject to Article 26(2) and (5), any consideration paid by the purchaser or the bridge undertaking shall benefit:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe owners of the shares or of other instruments of ownership, where such shares or such other instruments of ownership issued by the undertaking under resolution have been transferred from the holders of those shares or instruments to the purchaser or the bridge undertaking;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe undertaking under resolution, where some or all of the assets or liabilities of the undertaking under resolution have been transferred to the purchaser or the bridge undertaking.\n\n3.   Subject to Article 26(2) and (5), any consideration paid by an asset and liability management vehicle as referred to in Article 30(2) in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities acquired directly from the undertaking under resolution shall benefit the undertaking under resolution. Consideration may be paid in the form of debt issued by the asset and liability management vehicle.\n\n4.   Transfers made by using the asset and liability separation tool, the sale-of-business tool or the bridge undertaking tool shall be subject to the safeguards referred to in Title III, Chapter V.\n\n5.   Resolution authorities may use the asset and liability separation tool, the sale-of-business tool and the bridge undertaking tool more than once to make supplemental transfers where necessary to achieve the resolution objectives.\n\n6.   Member States shall ensure that a purchaser or bridge undertaking as referred to in paragraph 1 may continue to exercise the rights of membership and access to, where relevant, payment, clearing and settlement systems, stock exchanges and insurance guarantee schemes of the undertaking under resolution, provided that that purchaser or bridge undertaking meets the membership and participation criteria for participation in such systems.\n\nIn cases where not all criteria listed in the first subparagraph are met, Member States shall ensure that, where relevant:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nmembership or participation in payment, clearing and settlement systems, stock exchanges and insurance guarantee schemes is not denied on the grounds that the purchaser or the bridge undertaking does not possess a rating from a credit rating agency, or that such rating is not commensurate with the rating levels required to be granted access to such systems;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the purchaser or the bridge undertaking does not meet the membership or participation criteria of a payment, clearing or settlement system, stock exchange or insurance guarantee scheme, the rights referred to in the first subparagraph are exercised for a period specified by the resolution authorities, not exceeding 24 months, and renewable on application by the purchaser or the bridge undertaking to the resolution authority.\n\n7.   Without prejudice to Title III, Chapter V, shareholders or creditors of the undertaking under resolution and other third parties whose assets, rights or liabilities are not transferred by using the asset and liability separation tool, the sale-of-business tool or the bridge undertaking tool, shall not have any rights or claims over or in relation to the assets, rights or liabilities transferred or over or in relation to the administrative, management or supervisory body or senior management of the bridge undertaking or the assets and liabilities management vehicle.\n\nArticle 29\n\nProcedural requirements regarding sales of business, assets, rights or liabilities in resolution\n\n1.   Subject to paragraph 3, Member States shall ensure that, where resolution authorities seek to apply the sale-of-business tool, or sell a bridge undertaking, or its assets, rights or liabilities, the undertaking under resolution, the bridge undertaking or the assets, rights, liabilities, shares or other instruments of ownership concerned are marketed in accordance with the requirements set out in paragraph 2. Pools of rights, assets and liabilities may be marketed separately.\n\n2.   Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, the marketing referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nit shall be as transparent as possible and shall not materially misrepresent the assets, rights, liabilities, shares or other instruments of ownership of the undertaking or bridge undertaking that a resolution authority intends to transfer;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nit shall not unduly favour, or discriminate between, potential purchasers;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nit shall be free from any conflict of interest;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nit shall not confer any unfair advantage on a potential purchaser;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nit shall take account of the need to effect a rapid resolution action;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nit shall be aimed at maximising, as far as possible, the sale price for the shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities involved.\n\nThose requirements shall not prevent resolution authorities from soliciting particular potential purchasers.\n\nAny public disclosure of the marketing of an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), or of the bridge undertaking that would otherwise be required in accordance with Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 may be delayed in accordance with Article 17(4) or (5) of that Regulation.\n\n3.   Resolution authorities may adopt a reasoned decision not to comply with the requirement to market a sale where they determine that compliance with the requirements laid down in paragraph 2 would be likely to undermine one or more of the resolution objectives.\n\nArticle 30\n\nThe asset and liability separation tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to transfer assets, rights or liabilities of an undertaking under resolution or a bridge undertaking to one or more asset and liability management vehicles.\n\n2.   For the purposes of the asset and liability separation tool, an asset and liability management vehicle shall be a legal person that:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nis wholly or partially owned by one or more public authorities which may include the resolution authority and is controlled by the resolution authority; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nhas been created for the purpose of receiving some or all of the assets, rights and liabilities of one or more undertakings under resolution or a bridge undertaking.\n\n3.   The asset and liability management vehicle shall manage the portfolios transferred to it with a view to maximising their value through the sale of those portfolios or an orderly winding-down.\n\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the operation of an asset and liability management vehicle complies with the following requirements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority concerned has approved the asset and liability management vehicle’s constitutional documents;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nsubject to the asset and liability management vehicle’s ownership structure, the resolution authority concerned either appoints or approves the vehicle’s administrative, management or supervisory body;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority concerned approves the remuneration of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body and specifies their responsibilities;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority concerned approves the strategy and risk profile of the asset and liability management vehicle.\n\n5.   Resolution authorities may exercise the power specified in paragraph 1 to transfer assets, rights or liabilities only in conjunction with other resolution tools and where any of the following situations occurs:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe situation of the particular market for those assets, rights or liabilities is such that the liquidation of those assets, rights or liabilities under normal insolvency proceedings could have an adverse effect on one or more financial markets;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nsuch a transfer is necessary to facilitate the use of the solvent run-off tool or to ensure the proper functioning of the undertaking under resolution or a bridge undertaking;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nsuch a transfer is necessary to maximise liquidation proceeds.\n\n6.   When applying the asset and liability separation tool, resolution authorities shall, in accordance with Article 23 and in accordance with the Union State aid framework, determine the consideration for which assets, rights and liabilities are transferred to the asset and liability management vehicle. The consideration may have nominal or negative value.\n\n7.   Where resolution authorities have applied the bridge undertaking tool, asset and liability management vehicles may, subsequent to the application of the bridge undertaking tool, acquire assets, rights or liabilities from the bridge undertaking.\n\n8.   Resolution authorities may transfer assets, rights or liabilities from the undertaking under resolution to one or more asset and liability management vehicles on more than one occasion and transfer assets, rights or liabilities back from one or more asset and liability management vehicles to the undertaking under resolution in any of the following situations:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe possibility that the assets, rights or liabilities might be transferred back is stated expressly in the instrument under which the transfer was made;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe assets, rights or liabilities do not fall within the classes of, or meet the conditions for transfer of, assets, rights or liabilities specified in the instrument under which the transfer was made.\n\nIn either of the cases referred in the first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), the transfer back may be made within any period, and shall comply with any other conditions, stated in that instrument for the relevant purpose.\n\nThe undertaking under resolution shall be obliged to take back any assets, rights or liabilities transferred in accordance with the first subparagraph, points (a) and (b).\n\n9.   The objectives of an asset and liability management vehicle shall not imply any duty or responsibility to shareholders or creditors of the undertaking under resolution. The members of the administrative, management or supervisory body or senior management of the asset and liability management vehicle shall have no liability to such shareholders or creditors for acts or omissions in the discharge of their duties, unless such acts or omissions involved gross negligence or serious misconduct under national law which directly affected the rights of such shareholders or creditors.\n\nMember States may further limit the liability of an asset and liability management vehicle, and of the members of its administrative, management or supervisory body or senior management for acts and omissions in the discharge of their duties.\n\nArticle 31\n\nThe sale-of-business tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to transfer to a purchaser other than a bridge undertaking:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nshares or other instruments of ownership issued by an undertaking under resolution;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nall or any assets, rights or liabilities of an undertaking under resolution.\n\n2.   A transfer made pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be made on commercial terms, having regard to the circumstances, and in accordance with the Union State aid framework.\n\nResolution authorities shall take all reasonable steps to obtain commercial terms for the transfer that are consistent with the valuation conducted under Article 23, having regard to the circumstances of the case.\n\n3.   Resolution authorities may, with the consent of the purchaser, revert the executed transfers where justified by the circumstances of the case. The undertaking under resolution or the original owners shall be obliged to take back any transferred shares or other instruments of ownership, or assets, rights or liabilities.\n\n4.   Purchasers shall be required to have the appropriate authorisation to carry out the business they acquire when a transfer as referred to in paragraph 1 is made. Supervisory authorities shall ensure that any application for such authorisation is considered, in conjunction with the transfer, in a timely manner.\n\n5.   By way of derogation from Articles 57 to 62 of Directive 2009/138/EC, where a transfer of shares or of other instruments of ownership by virtue of an application of the sale-of-business tool would result in the acquisition of or increase in a qualifying holding in an insurance or reinsurance undertaking as referred to in Article 57(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC, the supervisory authority of that insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall carry out the assessment required under those Articles in a timely manner that does not delay the application of the sale-of-business tool or prevent the resolution action from achieving the resolution objectives.\n\n6.   Member States shall ensure that, where the supervisory authority has not completed the assessment referred to in paragraph 5 from the date of the transfer, the following apply:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsuch a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer shall have immediate legal effect;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nduring the assessment period and during any divestment period provided for in point (f), the acquirer’s voting rights attached to such shares or other instruments of ownership shall be suspended and vested solely in the resolution authority, which shall have no obligation to exercise any such voting rights and which shall have no liability whatsoever for exercising or refraining from exercising any such voting rights;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nduring the assessment period and during any divestment period provided for in point (f), the penalties and other measures for infringing the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying holdings laid down in Article 62 of Directive 2009/138/EC shall not apply to such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\npromptly upon completion of its assessment, the supervisory authority shall notify the resolution authority and the acquirer in writing of whether it approves or, in accordance with Article 58(4) of Directive 2009/138/EC, opposes such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the supervisory authority approves such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer, the voting rights attached to such shares or other instruments of ownership shall be deemed to be fully vested in the acquirer immediately upon receipt by the resolution authority and the acquirer of such an approval notice from the supervisory authority;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the supervisory authority opposes such a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership to the acquirer:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nthe voting rights attached to such shares or other instruments of ownership as provided for in point (b) shall remain in full force and effect;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority may require the acquirer to divest such shares or other instruments of ownership within a divestment period determined by the resolution authority having taken into account prevailing market conditions;\n\n(iii)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the acquirer does not comply with the request provided for in point (ii), the supervisory authority, with the consent of the resolution authority, may impose on the acquirer penalties and other measures for infringing the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying holdings laid down in Article 62 of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n7.   For the purpose of exercising the rights to provide services or to establish itself in another Member State in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC, the purchaser shall be considered to be a continuation of the undertaking under resolution, and may continue to exercise any such right that was exercised by the undertaking under resolution in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities transferred.\n\nArticle 32\n\nBridge undertaking tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to transfer to a bridge undertaking:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nshares or other instruments of ownership issued by one or more undertakings under resolution;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nall or any assets, rights or liabilities of one or more undertakings under resolution.\n\n2.   The bridge undertaking shall be a legal person that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nit is wholly or partially owned by one or more public authorities which may include the resolution authority or, where applicable, an insurance guarantee scheme and is controlled by the resolution authority;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nit is created for the purpose of receiving and holding some or all of the shares or other instruments of ownership issued by an undertaking under resolution or some or all of the assets, rights and liabilities of one or more undertakings under resolution with a view to achieving the resolution objectives and selling the undertaking under resolution.\n\n3.   When applying the bridge undertaking tool, resolution authorities shall ensure that the total value of liabilities transferred to the bridge undertaking does not exceed the total value of the rights and assets transferred from the undertaking under resolution.\n\n4.   Following an application of the bridge undertaking tool, resolution authorities may, where justified by the circumstances, revert the executed transfers, and the undertaking under resolution or the original owners shall be obliged to take back any transferred assets, rights or liabilities, or shares or other instruments of ownership, where justified by the circumstances of the case, in any of the following situations:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe possibility that the specific shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities might be transferred back is stated expressly in the instrument by which the transfer was made;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe specific shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities do not fall within the classes of, or meet the conditions for transfer of, shares or other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities specified in the instrument by which the transfer was made.\n\nA transfer back as referred to in the first subparagraph may be made within any period and shall comply with any other conditions stated in the instrument by which the transfer was made.\n\n5.   Following an application of the bridge undertaking tool, resolution authorities may transfer shares or other instruments of ownership, or assets, rights or liabilities from the bridge undertaking to a third-party purchaser.\n\n6.   A bridge undertaking shall be considered to be a continuation of the undertaking under resolution, and be able to continue to exercise any right that was exercised by the undertaking under resolution in respect of the assets, rights or liabilities transferred.\n\n7.   The objectives of a bridge undertaking shall not imply any duty or responsibility to shareholders or creditors of the undertaking under resolution. The members of the administrative, management or supervisory body or senior management of the bridge undertaking shall have no liability to such shareholders or creditors for acts or omissions in the discharge of their duties, unless such acts or omissions involved gross negligence or serious misconduct under national law which directly affected the rights of such shareholders or creditors.\n\nMember States may further limit the liability of a bridge undertaking and of the members of its administrative, management or supervisory body or senior management in accordance with national law for acts and omissions in the discharge of their duties.\n\nArticle 33\n\nOperation of a bridge undertaking\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the operation of a bridge undertaking respects the following requirements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority has approved the bridge undertaking’s constitutional documents;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nsubject to the bridge undertaking’s ownership structure, the resolution authority either appoints or approves the bridge undertaking’s administrative, management or supervisory body;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority approves the remuneration of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body and determines their responsibilities;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority approves the strategy and risk profile of the bridge undertaking;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking is authorised in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC and has the necessary authorisation under the applicable national law to carry out the activities or services that it acquires by virtue of a transfer made pursuant to Article 42 of this Directive;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking complies with the requirements of, and is subject to supervision in accordance with, Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nthe operation of the bridge undertaking complies with the Union State aid framework and the resolution authority may specify restrictions on its operations accordingly.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions referred to in the first subparagraph, points (e) and (f), and where necessary to meet the resolution objectives, a bridge undertaking may be established and authorised without complying with Directive 2009/138/EC for a short period at the beginning of its operation. To that end, the resolution authority shall submit a request in that sense to the supervisory authority. Where the supervisory authority decides to grant such an authorisation, it shall indicate the period for which the bridge undertaking is waived from complying with the requirements of Directive 2009/138/EC. That period shall not exceed 24 months.\n\n2.   Subject to any restrictions imposed by Union or national competition rules, the management of the bridge undertaking shall operate the bridge undertaking to achieve the resolution objectives and to sell the undertaking under resolution or the transferred assets, rights or liabilities to one or more private sector purchasers as soon as market conditions are appropriate.\n\n3.   Resolution authorities shall decide that an entity is no longer a bridge undertaking in any of the following situations, whichever occurs first:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking merges with another entity;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking ceases to meet the requirements of Article 32(2);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nall or substantially all of the bridge undertaking’s assets, rights or liabilities are sold to a third-party purchaser;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking’s assets are completely wound down and its liabilities are completely discharged.\n\n4.   Subject to Article 26(2) and (5), any proceeds generated as a result of the termination of the operation of the bridge undertaking shall benefit the shareholders of the bridge undertaking.\n\nArticle 34\n\nTransfer to insurance guarantee schemes\n\n1.   By way of derogation from Articles 32 and 33, Member States may provide that an appropriate insurance guarantee scheme is assigned with the duties and rights of a bridge undertaking. While ensuring the interests of policy holders, continuity of insurance relationships and settlement of claims, and ensuring that the objectives of this Directive are still adequately met, Member States may provide for a transfer, to such insurance guarantee scheme, of:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nshares or other instruments of ownership issued by one or more undertakings under resolution; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nall or any assets, rights or liabilities of one or more undertakings under resolution.\n\nResolution authorities shall ensure that the total value of liabilities transferred to the insurance guarantee scheme does not exceed the total value of the rights and assets transferred from the undertaking under resolution.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that an insurance guarantee scheme assigned with the duties and rights of a bridge undertaking respects the following requirements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority has approved the constitutional documents of the bridge undertaking;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority approves the remuneration of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body and determines their responsibilities;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe bridge undertaking shall not conclude new insurance contracts, or change existing insurance contracts in a way that could increase the insurance claims against the bridge undertaking;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe insurance guarantee scheme is subject to general rules and objectives of insurance supervision to ensure an adequate level of policy holder protection.\n\nPoint (b) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to an insurance guarantee scheme assigned with the duties and rights of a bridge undertaking if any transferred assets, rights, liabilities or rights of ownership are segregated from the other assets, rights and liabilities of the insurance guarantee scheme and remuneration is not paid from the transferred assets.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that the funding of an insurance guarantee scheme assigned with the duties and rights of a bridge undertaking is adequate to continue insurance relationships and guarantee the settlement of insurance claims.\n\nSection 4\n\nThe write-down or conversion tool\n\nArticle 35\n\nObjective and scope of the write-down or conversion tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may apply the write-down or conversion tool to meet the resolution objectives for any of the following purposes:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nto recapitalise an entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), that meets the conditions for resolution referred to in Article 19(1) and Article 20(3) to the extent sufficient to apply the solvent run-off tool and to maintain its authorisation under Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nto convert to equity or reduce the principal amount of claims, including insurance claims, or debt instruments that are transferred:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nto a bridge undertaking; or\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nunder the asset and liability separation tool or the sale-of-business tool.\n\nWhen applying the write-down or conversion tool to insurance claims, resolution authorities may also restructure the terms of the related insurance contracts to achieve the resolution objectives more effectively. When doing so, resolution authorities shall take into account the impact on the collective interest of policy holders.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities determine the amount by which capital instruments, debt instruments and other eligible liabilities are to be written down or converted for the purposes set out in paragraph 1 on the basis of the valuation carried out in accordance with Article 23.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may apply the write-down or conversion tool to all liabilities of entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), maintaining their current legal form or considering a change of their legal form where necessary.\n\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the write-down or conversion tool may be applied to all capital instruments and all liabilities of an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), that are not excluded from the scope of that tool pursuant to paragraphs 5 to 8 of this Article.\n\n5.   Resolution authorities shall not apply the write-down or conversion tool in relation to the following liabilities whether they are governed by the law of a Member State or of a third country:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsecured liabilities;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nliabilities to credit institutions, investment firms and insurance or reinsurance undertakings, except for entities that are part of the same group, with an original maturity of less than seven days;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nliabilities with a remaining maturity of less than seven days, owed to either systems or operators of systems designated in accordance with Directive 98/26/EC or to their participants and arising from the participation in such a system, or to CCPs authorised in the Union pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and third-country CCPs recognised by the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), pursuant to Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\na liability to any one of the following:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nan employee, in relation to accrued salary, pension benefits or other fixed remuneration, except for the variable component of remuneration that is not regulated by a collective bargaining agreement;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\na commercial or trade creditor arising from the provision to an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), of goods or services, such as IT services, utilities and the rental, servicing and upkeep of premises, that are needed to maintain the continuous functioning of the operations of that entity, or are needed for ensuring the continuity of insurance coverage;\n\n(iii)\n\n\t\n\ntax and social security authorities, provided that those liabilities are preferred under the applicable law;\n\n(iv)\n\n\t\n\ninsurance guarantee schemes arising from contributions due in accordance with applicable national laws;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nliabilities arising from compulsory insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles in accordance with Directive 2009/103/EC.\n\n6.   Member States may provide that resolution authorities are not to apply the write-down or conversion tool in relation to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nliabilities arising from current and future insurance claims which are covered by assets in accordance with Article 275(1), point (a), of Directive 2009/138/EC;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nliabilities arising under private health insurance contracts or private long-term care insurance contracts provided as an alternative to mandatory health or long-term care cover provided by the statutory social security system; the exclusion shall apply only to the part of the liability concerned that replaces the mandatory component of the statutory social security system.\n\n7.   Paragraph 5, point (a), and paragraph 6, point (a), shall not prevent resolution authorities, where appropriate, from applying the write-down or conversion tool to any part of a secured liability or a liability for which collateral has been pledged that exceeds the value of the assets, pledge, lien or collateral against which it is secured or to any part of liabilities referred to in paragraph 6, point (a), that exceed the value of the assets entered into the special register referred to in Article 276(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n8.   In exceptional circumstances, where the write-down or conversion tool is applied, resolution authorities may exclude or partially exclude certain liabilities from the application of the write-down or conversion tool in any of the following situations:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nit is not possible to write down or convert that liability within a reasonable time, notwithstanding the good faith efforts of the resolution authority;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe exclusion is strictly necessary and is proportionate to achieve the continuity of critical functions and core business lines in a manner that maintains the ability of the undertaking under resolution to continue key operations, services and transactions;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, in a manner that could cause a serious disturbance to the economy of a Member State or of the Union;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe application of the write-down or conversion tool to those liabilities would cause a destruction in value such that the losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if those liabilities were excluded from the application of the write-down or conversion tool; or\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to ensure that third parties are compensated for their personal injuries and damage covered by insurance contracts related to third-party liabilities where such contracts are compulsory under applicable law.\n\n9.   Resolution authorities shall take into account that, where the write-down or conversion tool is applied, insurance contracts the terms of which were restructured pursuant to paragraph 1, second subparagraph, meet, after the contract is restructured, the compulsory minimum coverage levels under applicable law.\n\nArticle 36\n\nTreatment of shareholders when applying the write-down or conversion tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, when applying the write-down or conversion tool, resolution authorities take, in respect of shareholders, one or both of the following actions:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ncancel existing shares or other instruments of ownership, or transfer them to creditors whose claims have been converted;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nprovided that the valuation carried out under Article 23 shows that the undertaking under resolution has a positive net value, dilute existing holdings of shares or other instruments of ownership by converting relevant capital instruments or debt instruments issued by the undertaking under resolution, or other eligible liabilities of the undertaking under resolution, into shares or other instruments of ownership pursuant to the application of the write-down or conversion tool.\n\nWith regard to point (b) of the first subparagraph, the conversion shall be conducted at a rate of conversion that severely dilutes existing holdings of shares or other instruments of ownership.\n\n2.   When considering which of the actions referred to in paragraph 1 to take, resolution authorities shall have regard to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe valuation carried out in accordance with Article 23;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe amount by which the resolution authority has assessed that Tier 1 items are to be reduced and relevant capital instruments written down or converted pursuant to Article 38(1).\n\n3.   By way of derogation from Articles 57 to 62 of Directive 2009/138/EC, where the conversion of capital instruments, debt instruments issued by the undertaking under resolution, or other eligible liabilities of the undertaking under resolution, would result in the acquisition of or increase in a qualifying holding in an insurance or reinsurance undertaking as referred to in Article 57(1) of that Directive, supervisory authorities shall carry out the assessment required under those Articles in a timely manner that does not delay the conversion of capital instruments or prevent resolution action from achieving the relevant resolution objectives.\n\n4.   Where the supervisory authority of that undertaking has not completed the assessment required under paragraph 3 on the date of the conversion of the capital instruments, Article 31(6) shall apply to any acquisition of or increase in a qualifying holding by an acquirer resulting from the conversion of capital instruments.\n\nArticle 37\n\nRate of conversion of debt to equity\n\nMember States shall ensure that, when resolution authorities apply the write-down or conversion tool and exercise the power specified in Article 42(1), point (h), they may apply a different conversion rate to different classes of capital instruments and liabilities in accordance with one or both of the following principles:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe conversion rate represents appropriate compensation to the affected creditor for any loss incurred by virtue of the exercise of the write-down or conversion powers;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe conversion rate applicable to liabilities that are considered to be senior under applicable insolvency law is higher than the conversion rate applicable to subordinated liabilities.\n\nArticle 38\n\nAdditional provisions governing the write-down or conversion tool\n\n1.   Resolution authorities shall apply the write-down or conversion tool in accordance with the priority of claims applicable under normal insolvency proceedings, in a way that produces the following results:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nTier 1 items are reduced first in proportion to the losses and to the extent of their capacity and the resolution authority takes one or both of the actions specified in Article 36(1) in respect of holders of Tier 1 instruments;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe principal amount of Tier 2 instruments is written down or converted into Tier 1 instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives or to the extent of the capacity of the relevant capital instruments, whichever is lower;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe principal amount of Tier 3 instruments is written down or converted into Tier 1 instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives or to the extent of the capacity of the relevant capital instruments, whichever is lower;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, the rest of eligible liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy of claims in normal insolvency proceedings, including the ranking of insurance claims provided for in Article 275(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC, is written down or converted into Tier 1 instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the resolution objectives.\n\nWhere the level of write-down based on the provisional valuation as referred to in Article 25 is found to exceed requirements when assessed against the definitive valuation as referred to in Article 24(2), a write-up mechanism may be applied to reimburse creditors and, subsequently, shareholders to the extent necessary.\n\nWhen deciding on whether liabilities are to be written down or converted into equity, resolution authorities shall not convert one class of liabilities, while a class of liabilities that is subordinated to the class remains unconverted into equity or not written down.\n\nMember States shall ensure that all claims resulting from own-fund items have, in national laws governing normal insolvency proceedings, a lower priority ranking than any claim that does not result from an own-fund item. For the purposes of this subparagraph, to the extent that an instrument is only partly recognised as an own-fund item, the whole instrument shall be treated as a claim resulting from an own-fund items and shall rank lower than any claim that does not result from an own-fund item.\n\n2.   Where the principal amount of a relevant capital instrument or the principal amount of a debt instrument or other eligible liability is written down, the following shall apply:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe reduction resulting from the application of the write-down or conversion tool shall be permanent, subject to any write-up in accordance with the reimbursement mechanism referred to in paragraph 1;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nno liability to the holder of the relevant capital instrument, the debt instrument or other eligible liability shall remain under or in connection with that amount of the instrument, which has been written down, except for any liability already accrued, and any liability for damages that may arise as a result of an appeal challenging the legality of the exercise of the write-down power;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nno compensation shall be paid to any holder of the relevant capital instrument, the debt instrument or other eligible liability other than in accordance with paragraph 3.\n\n3.   In order to effect a conversion of the capital instruments, debt instruments or other eligible liabilities concerned in accordance with paragraph 1, points (b) and (c), resolution authorities may require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to issue Tier 1 instruments to the holders of the capital instruments, debt instruments or other eligible liabilities concerned.\n\nThe capital instruments, debt instruments or other eligible liabilities concerned may be converted provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe Tier 1 instruments are issued by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking, by the entity referred to Article 1(1), points (b) to (e), or by the parent undertaking with the agreement of the relevant resolution authority;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe Tier 1 instruments are issued prior to any issuance of shares or other instruments of ownership by that entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), for the purposes of the provision of own funds by the State or a government entity;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe Tier 1 instruments are awarded and transferred without delay following the exercise of the conversion power;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe conversion rate that determines the number of Tier 1 instruments that are provided in respect of each relevant capital instrument, debt instrument or other eligible liability complies with Article 37.\n\n4.   For the purposes of the provision of Tier 1 instruments in accordance with paragraph 3, the resolution authority may require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to maintain at all times the necessary prior authorisation to issue the relevant number of Tier 1 instruments.\n\nArticle 39\n\nEffect of write-down or conversion\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, where a resolution authority applies the write-down or conversion tool and exercises the write-down or conversion powers in accordance with Article 35(1) and Article 42(1), points (g) to (k), the reduction of principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation takes effect and is immediately binding on the undertaking under resolution and affected creditors and shareholders.\n\n2.   The resolution authority shall complete or require the completion of all the administrative and procedural tasks necessary to give effect to the application of the write-down or conversion tool, including:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe amendment of all registers concerned;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe delisting, or removal from trading of shares or other instruments of ownership or debt instruments;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe listing, or admission to trading of new shares or other instruments of ownership;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe relisting or readmission of any debt instruments which have been written down, without having to issue a prospectus as required by Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21).\n\n3.   Where a resolution authority reduces to zero the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, a liability by means of the power referred to in Article 42(1), point (g), that liability and any obligations or claims arising in relation to it that are not accrued at the time when the power is exercised shall be treated as discharged for all purposes, and shall not be provable in any subsequent proceedings in relation to the undertaking under resolution or any successor entity in any subsequent winding-up.\n\n4.   Where a resolution authority reduces in part, but not in full, the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, a liability by means of the power referred to in Article 42(1), point (g):\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe liability shall be discharged to the extent of the amount reduced;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe instrument concerned or the agreement that created the original liability shall continue to apply in relation to the residual principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of the liability, subject to any modification of the amount of interest payable to reflect the reduction of the principal amount, and any further modification of the terms that the resolution authority might make by means of the power referred to in Article 42(1), point (l).\n\nArticle 40\n\nWrite-down or conversion of liabilities arising from derivatives\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities exercise the write-down or conversion powers in relation to a liability arising from a derivative only upon or after closing out the derivatives. Upon entry into resolution, resolution authorities shall be empowered to terminate and close out any derivative contract for that purpose. Where a derivative liability has been excluded from the application of the write-down or conversion tool under Article 35(8), resolution authorities shall not be obliged to terminate or close out the derivative contract.\n\n2.   Where derivative transactions are subject to a netting agreement, the resolution authority or an independent valuer shall determine, as part of the valuation under Article 23, the liability arising from those transactions on a net basis in accordance with the terms of the netting agreement.\n\n3.   Resolution authorities shall determine the value of liabilities arising from derivatives in accordance with all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nappropriate methodologies for determining the value of classes of derivatives, including transactions that are subject to netting agreements;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nprinciples for establishing the relevant point in time at which the value of a derivative position should be established;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nappropriate methodologies for comparing the destruction in value that would arise from the closeout and write-down or conversion of derivatives with the amount of losses that would be borne by derivatives in a write-down or conversion.\n\n4.   EIOPA, after consulting ESMA, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the methodologies and principles laid down in paragraph 3 on the valuation of liabilities arising from derivatives. In relation to derivative transactions that are subject to a netting agreement, EIOPA shall take into account the methodology for closeout set out in the netting agreement.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2027.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 41\n\nRemoval of procedural obstacles for write-down or conversion\n\n1.   Where the write-down or conversion tool is applied, Member States shall, where applicable, require the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to maintain at all times a sufficient amount of authorised share capital or of other Tier 1 instruments to ensure that those undertakings and entities are not prevented from issuing sufficient new shares or other instruments of ownership to ensure that the conversion of liabilities into shares or other instruments of ownership can be carried out effectively.\n\nResolution authorities shall assess compliance with the requirement laid down in the first subparagraph in the context of the development and maintenance of the resolution plans in accordance with Articles 9 and 10.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that there are no procedural impediments to the conversion of liabilities to shares or other instruments of ownership that exist by virtue of their instruments of incorporation or statutes, including pre-emption rights for shareholders or requirements for the consent of shareholders to an increase in capital.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nResolution powers\n\nArticle 42\n\nGeneral powers\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have all the powers necessary to apply resolution tools to the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), that meet the conditions for resolution laid down in Article 19(1) or 20(3), as applicable. In particular, resolution authorities shall have the following resolution powers, which they may exercise individually or in any combination:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to require any person to provide any information required for the resolution authority to decide upon and prepare a resolution action, including updates and supplements of information provided in the resolution plans and including

shareholders, other owners and the administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking under resolution;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to prohibit to underwrite new insurance or reinsurance business and to place an undertaking under resolution into an orderly solvent run-off procedure and terminate its activities;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to authorise a bridge undertaking established and authorised without complying with Directive 2009/138/EC during the short period referred to in Article 33(1), second subparagraph, of this Directive to underwrite new insurance or reinsurance business, or renew existing business;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to transfer shares or other instruments of ownership issued by an undertaking under resolution;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to transfer to another entity, with the consent of that entity, rights, assets or liabilities of an undertaking under resolution;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to restructure insurance claims or reduce, including to reduce to zero, the principal amount of or outstanding amount due in respect of debt instruments and eligible liabilities, including insurance claims, of an undertaking under resolution;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to convert debt instruments and eligible liabilities, including insurance claims, of an undertaking under resolution into ordinary shares or other instruments of ownership of an entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), of a relevant parent undertaking or of a bridge undertaking to which assets, rights or liabilities of the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), are transferred;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to cancel debt instruments issued by an undertaking under resolution, except for secured liabilities subject to Article 35(5);\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to reduce, including to reduce to zero, the nominal amount of shares or other instruments of ownership of an undertaking under resolution and to cancel such shares or other instruments of ownership;\n\n(k)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to require an undertaking under resolution or a relevant parent undertaking to issue new shares or other instruments of ownership or other capital instruments, including preference shares and contingent convertible instruments;\n\n(l)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to amend or alter the maturity of debt instruments and other eligible liabilities issued by an undertaking under resolution or amend the amount of interest payable under such instruments and other eligible liabilities, or the date on which the interest becomes payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period;\n\n(m)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to close out and terminate financial contracts or derivatives;\n\n(n)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to remove or replace the administrative, management or supervisory body and senior management of an undertaking under resolution;\n\n(o)\n\n\t\n\nthe power to require the supervisory authority to assess the buyer of a qualifying holding in a timely manner by way of derogation from the time-limits laid down in Article 58 of Directive 2009/138/EC.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the measures taken by the supervisory authority are terminated, if their continuation would hinder the use of resolution tools.\n\n3.   Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that, when applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers, resolution authorities are not subject to any of the following requirements that would otherwise apply by virtue of national law or contract or otherwise:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsubject to Article 3(8) and Article 67(1), requirements to obtain approval or consent from any person either public or private, including the shareholders, the creditors or the policy holders of the undertaking under resolution;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nprior to the exercise of the power, procedural requirements to notify any person, including any requirement to publish any notice or prospectus or to file or register any document with any other authority.\n\nPoint (b) of the first subparagraph is without prejudice to the requirements laid down in Articles 63 and 65 and any notification requirements under the Union State aid framework.\n\n4.   Member States shall ensure that, to the extent that any of the powers listed in paragraph 1 of this Article is not applicable to an entity within the scope of Article 1(1) as a result of its specific legal form of mutual undertaking or cooperative society, resolution authorities have powers which are as similar as possible to those listed in paragraph 1 of this Article, including in terms of their effects.\n\n5.   Member States shall ensure that, when resolution authorities exercise the powers laid down in paragraph 4, the safeguards provided for in Chapter V of this Directive, or safeguards that deliver the same effect, are applied to the persons affected, including shareholders, creditors, policy holders and counterparties.\n\nArticle 43\n\nAncillary powers\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities, when exercising a resolution power, have the power to do all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsubject to Article 60, provide for a transfer to take effect, free from any liability or encumbrance affecting the financial instruments, rights, assets or liabilities transferred;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nremove rights to acquire any additional shares or other instruments of ownership;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nrequire the authority concerned to discontinue or suspend the admission

claims without the consent of the reinsurance undertaking where the resolution authority transfers assets and liabilities related to those reinsurance rights of the undertaking under resolution in whole or in part to another entity.\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), any right of compensation provided in accordance with this Directive shall not be considered to be a liability or an encumbrance.\n\n2.   Resolution authorities shall exercise the powers specified in paragraph 1 where they consider such exercise to be appropriate to ensure that a resolution action is effective or to achieve one or more resolution objectives.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities exercising a resolution power have the power to provide for continuity arrangements necessary to ensure that the resolution action is effective and, where relevant, to ensure that the business transferred may be operated by the recipient.

Member States shall further ensure that the special manager has the qualifications, ability and knowledge to carry out his or her functions. Member States may provide that a resolution authority may appoint several special managers.\n\n2.   The special manager shall have all the powers of the shareholders and of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking under resolution. The special manager shall exercise those powers under the control of the resolution authority. The resolution authority may limit the actions of the special manager or require prior consent for certain acts.\n\nThe resolution authority shall make public the appointment referred to in paragraph 1 and the terms and conditions attached to that appointment.\n\n3.   The special manager shall have the statutory duty to take all the measures necessary to promote the resolution objectives and implement resolution actions taken by the resolution authority. In the event of inconsistency or conflict with any other duty of management laid down in the statutes of the undertaking or in national law, that statutory duty shall override such other duty.\n\n4.   Member States shall require that the special manager draw up reports for the resolution authority that appointed him or her, at regular intervals set by the resolution authority and at the beginning and the end of his or her mandate. Those reports shall describe in detail the financial position of the undertaking under resolution and state the reasons for the measures taken.\n\n5.   The special manager shall not be appointed for more than one year.

have the powers necessary to ensure that the goods and services provided, directly or indirectly, by an essential service provider to an undertaking under resolution can continue to be provided by it after resolution action has been taken where:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe assets of the essential service provider are or there are objective elements to support a determination that the assets of the essential service provider will, in the near future, be less than its liabilities; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe essential service provider is unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due, or there are objective elements to support a determination that the essential service provider will, in the near future, be in such a situation.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that their resolution authorities have powers to enforce obligations imposed, pursuant to paragraph 1, on group entities established in their territory by resolution authorities established in other Member States.\n\n4.   The operational services and facilities provided in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be on the following terms:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the operational services and facilities

agreement or where the agreement has expired, on reasonable terms.\n\nArticle 46\n\nPower to enforce crisis management measures by other Member States\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, where a transfer of shares, other instruments of ownership, or assets, rights or liabilities includes assets that are located in a Member State other than the Member State of the resolution authority, or includes rights or liabilities under the law of a Member State other than the Member State of the resolution authority, the transfer has effect in or under the law of that other Member State.\n\n2.   Member States shall provide the resolution authority that has made, or intends to make, the transfer, with all reasonable assistance to ensure that the shares or other instruments of ownership or assets, rights or liabilities are transferred to the recipient in accordance with any applicable requirements of national law.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that shareholders, creditors and third parties that are affected by a transfer of shares, other instruments of ownership, assets, rights or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 1, are not entitled to prevent, challenge, or set aside the transfer under any provision of law of the Member State where the assets are located or of the law governing the shares, other instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities.\n\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the principal amount of capital instruments, debt instruments or other eligible liabilities is reduced, or that such liabilities or instruments are converted, in accordance with the exercise of write-down or conversion powers by a resolution authority of another Member State to an undertaking under resolution, where the relevant liabilities or instruments:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nare governed by the law of the Member State other than the Member State of the resolution authority that exercised the write-down or conversion powers;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nare owed to creditors located in the Member State other than the Member State of the resolution authority that exercised the write-down or conversion powers.\n\n5.   Member States shall ensure that shareholders and creditors that are affected by the exercise of write-down or conversion powers referred to in paragraph 4 are not entitled to challenge the reduction of the principal amount of the instrument or liability or its conversion, as the case may be, under any provision of law of the Member State other than the Member State of the resolution authority that exercised the write-down or conversion powers.\n\n6.   Each Member State shall ensure that all of the following is determined in accordance with the law of the Member State of the resolution authority:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe right

instrument or liability covered by paragraph 4, point (a) or (b), of this Article;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe safeguards for partial transfers, as referred to in Chapter V, in relation to the assets, rights or liabilities referred to in paragraph 1.\n\nArticle 47\n\nPower in respect of assets, rights, liabilities, shares and other instruments of ownership located in or governed by the law of third countries\n\n1.   Member States shall provide that, in cases in which resolution action involves action taken in respect of assets located in a third country or shares, other instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities governed by the law of a third country, resolution authorities may require that:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe person exercising control over the undertaking under resolution and the recipient take all steps necessary to ensure that the resolution action becomes effective;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe person exercising control over the undertaking under resolution hold the shares, other instruments of ownership, assets or rights or discharge the liabilities on behalf of the recipient until the resolution action becomes effective;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe reasonable expenses of the recipient properly incurred in carrying out any action required under points (a) and (b) are met in any of the ways referred to in Article 26(5).\n\n2.   In order to facilitate potential action pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States shall require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to include into the related agreements contractual terms by which shareholders, creditors or parties to the agreement creating the liability recognise that the liability may be subject to write-down or conversion powers and agree to be bound by any reduction of the principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation that is effected by the exercise of those powers by a resolution authority.\n\nMember States shall ensure that resolution authorities may require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to provide those resolution authorities with a reasoned legal opinion by an independent legal expert confirming the legal enforceability and effectiveness of such contractual terms.\n\n3.   Where a resolution authority assesses that, in spite of all the necessary steps taken by the person exercising control over the undertaking under resolution in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a), it is highly unlikely that the resolution action will become effective in relation to certain assets located in a third country or certain shares, other instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities governed by the law of a third country, the resolution authority shall not proceed with the resolution action. Where the resolution authority has already ordered the resolution action, that order shall be void in relation to the assets, shares, instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities concerned.\n\nArticle 48\n\nExclusion of certain contractual terms\n\n1.   A crisis prevention measure or a crisis management measure taken in relation to an entity, including the occurrence of any event directly linked to the application of such a measure, shall not, per se, under a contract entered into by the entity concerned, be deemed to be an enforcement event within the meaning of Directive 2002/47/EC or insolvency proceedings within the meaning of Directive 98/26/EC, provided that the substantive obligations under that contract, including payment and delivery obligations and the provision of collateral, continue to be performed.\n\nIn addition, a crisis prevention measure or a crisis management measure shall not, per se, be deemed to be an enforcement event within the meaning of Directive 2002/47/EC or insolvency proceedings within the meaning of Directive 98/26/EC under a contract entered into by:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na subsidiary undertaking, where the parent undertaking or any group entity guarantees or otherwise supports the obligations under that contract; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nany entity of a group, where the contract contains cross-default provisions.\n\n2.   Where third-country resolution proceedings are recognised pursuant to Article 76, or, in the absence of such recognition, where a resolution authority so decides, third-country resolution proceedings shall for the purposes of this Article constitute a crisis management measure.\n\n3.   Provided that the substantive obligations under the contract, including payment and delivery obligations, and provision of collateral, continue to be performed, a crisis prevention measure, or a crisis management measure, including any event directly linked to the application of such a measure, shall not, per se, make it possible for anyone to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nexercise any termination, suspension, modification, netting or set-off rights, including in relation to a contract entered into by:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\na subsidiary undertaking, where the obligations under the contract are guaranteed or otherwise supported by a group entity;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nany group entity, where the contract contains cross-default provisions;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nobtain possession, exercise control or enforce any security over any property of any of the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), concerned or any group entity in relation to a contract which contains cross-default provisions;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\naffect any contractual rights of any of the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), concerned or any group entity in relation to a contract which contains cross-default provisions.\n\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not affect the right of a person to take an action as referred to in paragraph 3, point (a), (b) or (c), where that right arises by virtue of an event other than the crisis prevention measure, the crisis management measure, or by virtue of any event directly linked to the application of such a measure.\n\n5.   A suspension or restriction under Article 49 or 50 shall not constitute non-performance of a contractual obligation for the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article and of Article 51(1).\n\n6.   The provisions contained in this Article shall be considered to be overriding mandatory provisions within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).\n\nArticle 49\n\nPower to suspend certain obligations\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to suspend any payment or delivery obligations pursuant to any contract to which an undertaking under resolution is a party from the publication of a notice of the suspension in accordance with Article 65(3) until midnight in the Member State of the resolution authority of the undertaking under resolution at the end of the business day following that publication.\n\n2.   A payment or delivery obligation that would have been due during the suspension period referred to in paragraph 1 shall be due immediately upon expiry of the suspension period.\n\n3.   Where an undertaking under resolution’s payment or delivery obligations under a contract are suspended in accordance with paragraph 1, the payment or delivery obligations of the undertaking under resolution’s counterparties under that contract shall be suspended for the same period.\n\n4.   Any suspension under paragraph 1 shall not apply to payment and delivery obligations owed to the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsystems and operators of systems designated in accordance with Directive 98/26/EC;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nCCPs authorised in the Union pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and third-country CCPs recognised by ESMA pursuant to Article 25 of that Regulation.\n\n5.   When exercising a power under this Article, resolution authorities shall have regard to the impact the exercise of that power might have.\n\nThe resolution authorities shall set the scope of that power having regard to the circumstances of each case.\n\nArticle 50\n\nPower to restrict the enforcement of security interests\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to restrict secured creditors of an undertaking under resolution from enforcing security interests in relation to any assets of that undertaking from the publication of a notice of the restriction in accordance with Article 65(3) until midnight in the Member State of the resolution authority of the undertaking under resolution at the end of the business day following that publication.\n\n2.   Any restriction under paragraph 1 shall not apply to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsecurity interest of systems or operators of systems designated for the purposes of Directive 98/26/EC;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nCCPs authorised in the Union pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and third-country CCPs recognised by ESMA pursuant to Article 25 of that Regulation.\n\n3.   Where Article 62 applies, resolution authorities shall ensure that any restrictions imposed pursuant to the power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article are consistent for all group entities in relation to which a resolution action is taken.\n\nArticle 51\n\nPower to temporarily suspend termination rights\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to suspend the termination rights of any party to a contract with an undertaking under resolution from the publication of the notice in accordance with Article 65(3) until midnight in the Member State of the resolution authority of the undertaking under resolution at the end of the business day following that publication, provided that the payment and delivery obligations and the provision of collateral continue to be performed.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to suspend the termination rights of any party to a contract with a subsidiary undertaking of an undertaking under resolution where any of the following applies:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe obligations under that contract are guaranteed or are otherwise supported by the undertaking under resolution;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe termination rights under that contract are based solely on the insolvency or financial condition of the undertaking under resolution;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nin the case of a transfer power that has been or may be exercised in relation to the undertaking under resolution, either:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nall the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary undertaking relating to that contract have been or may be transferred to and assumed by the recipient; or\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority provides in any other way adequate protection for such obligations.\n\nThe suspension of the termination rights shall take effect from the publication of the notice in accordance with Article 65(3) until midnight in the Member State where the subsidiary undertaking of the undertaking under resolution is established on the business day following that publication.\n\n3.   Any suspension under paragraph 1 or 2 shall not apply to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsystems or operators of systems designated for the purposes of Directive 98/26/EC; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nCCPs authorised in the Union pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and third-country CCPs recognised by ESMA pursuant to Article 25 of that Regulation.\n\n4.   A person may exercise a termination right under a contract before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 where that person receives notice from the resolution authority that the rights and liabilities covered by the contract shall not be:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ntransferred to another entity; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nsubject to write-down or conversion in accordance with Article 35(1), point (a).\n\n5.   Where a resolution authority exercises the power specified in paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article to suspend termination rights, and where no notice has been given pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, those termination rights may be exercised on the expiry of the period of suspension, subject to Article 48, as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the rights and liabilities covered by the contract have been transferred to another entity, a counterparty may exercise those termination rights in accordance with the terms of that contract only on the occurrence of any continuing or subsequent enforcement event by the recipient;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhere the rights and liabilities covered by the contract remain with the undertaking under resolution and the resolution authority has not applied the write-down or conversion tool to that contract for the purpose laid down in Article 35(1), point (a), a counterparty may exercise termination rights in accordance with the terms of that contract on the expiry of a suspension referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\nArticle 52\n\nContractual recognition of resolution stay powers\n\n1.   Member States shall require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to include in any financial contract which they enter into and which is governed by third-country law, terms by which the parties recognise that the financial contract may be subject to the exercise of powers by the resolution authority to suspend or restrict rights and obligations under Articles 49, 50, and 51, and recognise that they are bound by the requirements of Article 48.\n\n2.   Member States may also require that ultimate parent undertakings ensure that their third-country subsidiary undertakings which are entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), include, in the financial contracts referred to in paragraph 1, terms to exclude that the exercise of the power of the resolution authority to suspend or restrict rights and obligations of the ultimate parent undertaking, in accordance with paragraph 1, constitutes a valid ground for early termination, suspension, modification, netting, exercise of set-off rights or enforcement of security interests on those contracts.\n\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to any financial contract which:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ncreates a new obligation, or materially amends an existing obligation after the entry into force of the provisions adopted at national level to transpose this Article;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nprovides for the exercise of one or more termination rights or rights to enforce security interests to which Article 48, 49, 50 or 51 would apply if the financial contract were governed by the laws of a Member State.\n\n4.   The fact that an entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), does not include in its financial contracts the contractual terms referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not prevent the resolution authority from applying the powers referred to in Articles 48, 49, 50 and 51 in relation to those financial contracts.\n\n5.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the contents of the contractual terms referred to in paragraph 1, taking into account the different business models of the entities referred to therein.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2027.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 53\n\nPower to temporarily suspend redemption rights\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the power to temporarily restrict or suspend redemption rights of policy holders in relation to life insurance contracts written by the undertaking under resolution, provided that the substantive obligations under the contracts, and in particular payment obligations for the benefit of policy holders, beneficiaries or injured parties, continue to be performed.\n\n2.   The power referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used only for as long as is necessary to facilitate the application of one or more resolution tools. That power shall be valid for the period specified in the notice of suspension published in accordance with Article 65(3).\n\nArticle 54\n\nExercise of the resolution powers\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities are able to exercise control over the undertaking under resolution, so as to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\noperate and conduct the activities and services of the undertaking under resolution with all the powers of its shareholders and administrative, management or supervisory body;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nmanage and dispose of the assets and property of the undertaking under resolution.\n\nThe control referred to in the first subparagraph may be exercised directly by the resolution authority or indirectly by a person or persons appointed by the resolution authority. Member States shall ensure that voting rights conferred by shares or other instruments of ownership of the undertaking under resolution cannot be exercised during the period of resolution.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities, subject to the right of appeal referred to in Article 67, are able to take a resolution action through executive order in accordance with national administrative competences and procedures, without exercising control over the undertaking under resolution.\n\n3.   Resolution authorities shall decide in each particular case whether it is appropriate to carry out the resolution action through the means specified in paragraph 1 or in paragraph 2, having regard to the resolution objectives and the general principles governing resolution laid down in Article 22, the specific circumstances of the undertaking under resolution in question and the need to facilitate the effective resolution of cross-border groups.\n\n4.   Resolution authorities shall not be deemed to be shadow directors or de facto directors under national law.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSafeguards\n\nArticle 55\n\nTreatment of shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors in the case of partial transfers and application of the write-down or conversion tool\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, where one or more resolution tools have been applied, except in a situation described in paragraph 2 of this Article, and where resolution authorities transfer only parts of the rights, assets and liabilities of the undertaking under resolution, the shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors whose claims have not been transferred receive in satisfaction of their claims at least as much as what they would have received if the undertaking under resolution had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings at the time when the decision referred to in Article 64 was taken.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that, where one or more resolution tools have been applied and where resolution authorities apply the write-down or conversion tool, the shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors whose claims have been written down or converted to equity do not incur greater losses than they would have incurred if the undertaking under resolution had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings immediately at the time when the decision referred to in Article 64 was taken.\n\nArticle 56\n\nValuation of difference in treatment\n\n1.   For the purpose of assessing whether shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors would have received better treatment if the undertaking under resolution had entered into normal insolvency proceedings, Member States shall ensure that an independent person carries out a valuation as soon as possible after the resolution action or actions have been effected. That valuation shall be distinct from the valuation carried out under Article 23.\n\n2.   The valuation referred to in paragraph 1 shall determine:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe treatment that shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants, other creditors or the relevant insurance guarantee schemes would have received if the undertaking under resolution with respect to which the resolution action or actions have been effected had entered normal insolvency proceedings at the time when the decision referred to in Article 64 was taken;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe actual treatment that shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors have received in the resolution of the undertaking under resolution;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nwhether there is any difference between the treatment referred to in point (a) and the treatment referred to in point (b).\n\n3.   The valuation shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nassume that the undertaking under resolution with respect to which the resolution action or actions have been effected would have entered normal insolvency proceedings at the time when the decision referred to in Article 64 was taken;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nassume that the resolution action or actions had not been effected;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\ntake into account a commercially reasonable estimate of the replacement costs, including brokerage and closing fees, of already purchased policies for appropriate cohorts of policy holders at the time when the decision referred to in Article 64 was taken;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\ndisregard any provision of extraordinary public financial support to the undertaking under resolution.\n\n4.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the methodology for carrying out the valuation referred to in this Article, in particular the methodology for assessing the treatment that shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors would have received if the undertaking under resolution had entered insolvency proceedings at the time when the decision referred to in Article 64 was taken and the methodology for the estimation of the replacement costs.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2027.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 57\n\nSafeguard for shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants or other creditors\n\nMember States shall ensure that, where the valuation carried out under Article 56 determines that any shareholder, policy holder, beneficiary, claimant or other creditor referred to in Article 55 or, where relevant, the insurance guarantee scheme in accordance with the applicable national law, has incurred greater losses than it would have incurred in a winding-up under normal insolvency proceedings, it is entitled to payment of the difference.\n\nArticle 58\n\nSafeguard for counterparties in partial transfers\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure appropriate protection of the following arrangements and of the counterparties to the following arrangements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nsecurity arrangements, under which a person has by way of security an actual or contingent interest in the assets or rights that are subject to transfer, irrespective of whether that interest is secured by specific assets or rights or by way of a floating charge or similar arrangement;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\ntitle transfer financial collateral arrangements, under which collateral to secure or cover the performance of specified obligations is provided by a transfer of full ownership of assets from the collateral provider to the collateral taker, on terms providing for the collateral taker to transfer assets where those specified obligations are performed;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nset-off arrangements, under which two or more claims or obligations owed between the undertaking under resolution and a counterparty can be set off against each other;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nnetting arrangements;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nunit-linked policies or other ring-fenced portfolios;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nreinsurance agreements;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nstructured finance arrangements, including securitisations and instruments used for hedging purposes which form an integral part of the cover pool and which according to national law are secured, and involve the granting and holding of security by a party to the arrangement or a trustee, agent or nominee.\n\nThe form of protection that is appropriate, for the classes of arrangements specified in the first subparagraph, points (a) to (g), shall be chosen in accordance with Articles 59 to 62.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the protections specified in paragraph 1 apply in the following circumstances:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na resolution authority transfers some but not all of the assets, rights or liabilities of an undertaking under resolution to another entity or, in the application of a resolution tool, from a bridge undertaking or asset and liability management vehicle to another person;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\na resolution authority exercises the powers specified in Article 43(1), point

In such a case, all references to resolution colleges in this Directive shall be understood as references to those other groups or colleges.\n\n7.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the operational functioning of the resolution colleges for the performance of the tasks referred to in paragraph 1.\n\nEIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2026.\n\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\nArticle 71\n\nEuropean resolution colleges\n\n1.   Where a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking or third-country parent undertaking has Union subsidiary undertakings established in two or more Member States, or two or more Union branches of a third-country undertaking that are regarded as significant by two or more Member States, the resolution authorities of the Member States where those Union subsidiary undertakings are established or where those Union branches of a third-country undertaking are located may establish a European resolution college.\n\n2.   The European resolution college shall perform the functions and carry out the tasks specified in Article 70 with respect to the Union subsidiary undertakings and, insofar as those tasks are relevant, to Union branches of a third-country undertaking referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and shall otherwise function in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 70.\n\n3.   Where only one parent undertaking established in a Member State holds all Union subsidiary undertakings of a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking or third-country parent undertaking, the European resolution college shall be chaired by the resolution authority of the Member State where that parent undertaking is established.\n\nWhere the first subparagraph does not apply, the resolution authority of the Member State in which a Union subsidiary undertaking with the highest value of total on-balance sheet assets is established shall chair the European resolution college.\n\nArticle 72\n\nInformation exchange\n\n1.   Subject to Article 66, resolution authorities and supervisory authorities shall provide one another on request with all the information relevant for the exercise of the other authorities’ tasks under this Directive.\n\n2.   The group-level resolution authority shall coordinate the flow of all relevant information between resolution authorities. In particular, the group-level resolution authority shall provide the resolution authorities in other Member States with all the relevant information in a timely manner to facilitate the exercise of the tasks referred to in Article 70(1), second subparagraph, points (b) to (h).\n\n3.   A resolution authority shall not transmit information that has been provided by a third-country supervisory or resolution authority unless that third-country supervisory or resolution authority has consented to such transmission.\n\nArticle 73\n\nGroup resolution involving a subsidiary undertaking of the group\n\n1.   A resolution authority shall notify the information listed in paragraph 2 without delay to the group-level resolution authority, if different, to the group supervisor, and to the members of the resolution college concerned where:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority decides that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking of a group, is failing or likely to fail; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authority has been informed by the supervisory authority that a decision has been made that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking of a group, is failing or likely to fail; or\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\na resolution authority decides that an entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), that is a subsidiary undertaking of a group, meets the conditions for resolution laid down in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3).\n\n2.   The information to be notified pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe decision determining that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is failing or likely to fail;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe decision that the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), meets the conditions for resolution laid down in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution actions or insolvency measures that the resolution authority considers to be appropriate for the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e).\n\n3.   On receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the group-level resolution authority, after having consulted the other members of the resolution college concerned, shall assess the likely impact of the resolution actions or other measures notified pursuant to paragraph 2, point (c), on the group and on group entities in other Member States, and whether the resolution actions or other measures would make it likely that the conditions for resolution referred to in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3) would be satisfied in relation to a group entity in another Member State.\n\n4.   Where the group-level resolution authority assesses that the resolution actions or other measures notified pursuant to paragraph 2, point (c), would not make it likely that the conditions laid down in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3) would be satisfied in relation to a group entity in another Member State, the resolution authority responsible for the entity referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), may take the resolution actions or other measures that it notified.\n\n5.   Where the group-level resolution authority assesses that the resolution actions or other measures notified pursuant to paragraph 2, point (c), would make it likely that the conditions laid down in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3) would be satisfied in relation to a group entity in another Member State, the group-level resolution authority shall, after receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 1, propose a group resolution scheme within five days and submit that scheme to the resolution college. That five-day period may be extended with the consent of the resolution authority which made the notification.\n\n6.   In the absence of an assessment by the group-level resolution authority within five days, or a longer period that has been agreed, after having received the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the resolution authority which made the notification may take the resolution actions or other measures that it notified.\n\n7.   The group resolution scheme referred to in paragraph 5 shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\noutline the resolution actions that the resolution authorities concerned should take in relation to the ultimate parent undertaking or particular group entities to meet the resolution objectives and to comply with the general principles governing resolution laid down in Article 22;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nspecify how the resolution actions referred to in point (a) should be coordinated;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nestablish a financing plan which takes into account the group resolution plan and the principles for sharing responsibility set out in that group resolution plan in accordance with Article 10(2), point (e).\n\n8.   Subject to paragraph 9, the group resolution scheme shall take the form of a joint decision of the group-level resolution authority and the resolution authorities responsible for the subsidiary undertakings that are covered by the group resolution scheme.\n\nEIOPA may, at the request of a resolution authority, assist the resolution authorities in reaching a joint decision in accordance with Article 31(2), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\n9.   A resolution authority that disagrees with the group resolution scheme proposed by the group-level resolution authority or that considers that, for reasons of protection of the collective interest of policy holders, the real economy and financial stability, it needs to take independent resolution actions or measures other than those proposed in the group resolution scheme in relation to an entity referred to in of Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nset out in detail the reasons for the disagreement or the reasons to depart from the group resolution scheme;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nnotify the group-level resolution authority and the other resolution authorities that are covered by the group resolution scheme of the reasons referred to in point (a);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\ninform the group-level resolution authority and the other resolution authorities that are concerned by the group resolution scheme about the resolution actions or measures it will take.\n\nWhen setting out the reasons for its disagreement, the resolution authority shall take into consideration the group resolution plans, the potential impact of the resolution actions or measures it will take on policy holders, the real economy and financial stability in the Member States concerned, and the potential effect of those resolution actions or measures on other parts of the group.\n\n10.   Resolution authorities that agree with the group resolution scheme proposed by the group-level resolution authority may reach a joint decision on a group resolution scheme covering group entities in those resolution authorities’ Member States without the participation of the disagreeing resolution authorities.\n\n11.   The joint decisions referred to in paragraphs 8 and 10 and the resolution actions or measures taken in accordance with paragraph 9 shall be recognised as conclusive and applied by the resolution authorities in the Member States concerned.\n\n12.   Resolution authorities shall take all resolution actions and measures referred to in this Article without delay, and with due regard to the urgency of the situation.\n\n13.   Where a group resolution scheme is not implemented, resolution authorities shall, when taking resolution actions in relation to any group entity, cooperate closely within the resolution college to achieve a coordinated resolution strategy for all the group entities that are failing or likely to fail.\n\n14.   Resolution authorities that take any resolution action in relation to any group entity shall inform the members of the resolution college regularly and fully about those actions or measures and their on-going progress.\n\nArticle 74\n\nGroup resolution involving an ultimate parent undertaking\n\n1.   A group-level resolution authority that decides that an ultimate parent undertaking for which it is responsible meets the conditions referred to in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3) shall notify the information referred to in Article 73(2) to the group supervisor and to the other members of the resolution college of the group in question without delay.\n\nThe resolution actions or insolvency measures referred to in Article 73(2), point (c), may include the implementation of a group resolution scheme drawn up in accordance with Article 73(7) in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution actions or measures at parent level notified in accordance with Article 73(2), point (c), make it likely that the conditions laid down in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3) would be fulfilled in relation to a group entity in another Member State;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nresolution actions or other measures at parent level only are not sufficient to stabilise the situation or are not likely to provide an optimum outcome;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe resolution authorities have determined that one or more subsidiary undertakings for which they are responsible meet the conditions referred to in Article 19(1) or Article 20(3);\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nresolution actions or other measures at group level will benefit the subsidiary undertakings of the group in a way that makes a group resolution scheme appropriate.\n\n2.   Where the actions or measures proposed by the group-level resolution authority do not contain a group resolution scheme, the group-level resolution authority shall take its decision after having consulted the members of the resolution college.\n\n3.   Where the actions or measures proposed by the group-level resolution authority do contain a group resolution scheme, the group resolution scheme shall take the form of a joint decision of the group-level resolution authority and the resolution authorities responsible for the subsidiary undertakings that are covered by the group resolution scheme.\n\nEIOPA may, at the request of a resolution authority, assist the resolution authorities in reaching a joint decision in accordance with Article 31(2), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.\n\n4.   A resolution authority that disagrees with or departs from the group resolution scheme proposed by the group-level resolution authority or considers that, for reasons of financial stability, it needs to take independent resolution actions or measures other than those proposed in the group resolution scheme in relation to an entity as referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e) shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nset out in detail the reasons for the disagreement or the reasons to depart from the group resolution scheme;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nnotify the group-level resolution authority and the other resolution authorities that are covered by the group resolution scheme of the reasons referred to in point (a);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\ninform the group-level resolution authority and the other resolution authorities that are covered by the group resolution scheme about the actions or measures it intends to take.\n\nWhen setting out the reasons for its disagreement, the resolution authority concerned shall give due consideration to the group resolution plans, the potential impact of the independent resolution actions or measures it will take on financial stability, fiscal resources, insurance guarantee schemes and any financing arrangements in the Member States concerned and the potential effect of the resolution actions or other measures on other parts of the group.\n\n5.   Resolution authorities that agree with the group resolution scheme proposed by the group-level resolution authority may reach a joint decision on a group resolution scheme covering group entities in their respective Member States without the participation of the disagreeing resolution authorities.\n\n6.   The joint decision referred to in paragraph 3 or 5 and the resolution actions and measures referred to in paragraph 4 shall be recognised as conclusive and applied by the resolution authorities in the Member States concerned.\n\n7.   Authorities shall perform all resolution actions and measures referred to in paragraphs 1 to 6 without delay, and with due regard to the urgency of the situation.\n\n8.   Where a group resolution scheme is not implemented, resolution authorities shall, when taking resolution action in relation to any group entity, cooperate closely within the resolution college to achieve a coordinated resolution strategy for all affected group entities.\n\n9.   Resolution authorities that take resolution action in relation to any group entity shall inform the members of the resolution college regularly and fully about those actions or measures and their on-going progress.\n\nTITLE V\n\nRELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES\n\nArticle 75\n\nAgreements with third countries\n\n1.   In accordance with Article 218 TFEU, the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the negotiation of agreements with one or more third countries regarding the means of cooperation between the resolution authorities and the third-country authorities concerned, including the sharing of information in connection with recovery and resolution planning in relation to insurance and reinsurance undertakings, third-country insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and groups.\n\n2.   The agreements referred to in paragraph 1 shall seek to ensure the establishment of processes and arrangements between resolution authorities and the third-country authorities concerned for cooperation in carrying out some or all of the tasks and exercising some or all of the powers referred to in Article 79.\n\n3.   Member States may enter into bilateral agreements with a third country, to the extent that such bilateral agreements are not inconsistent with this Title, regarding the matters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 until the entry into force of an agreement as referred to in paragraph 1 with the relevant third country.\n\nArticle 76\n\nRecognition and enforcement of third-country resolution proceedings\n\n1.   This Article shall apply in respect of third-country resolution proceedings unless and until an international agreement as referred to in Article 75(1) enters into force with the third country concerned. It shall also apply following the entry into force of such an international agreement with the third country concerned to the extent that recognition and enforcement of third-country resolution proceedings is not governed by that agreement.\n\n2.   The resolution authority concerned shall decide whether to recognise and enforce, except as provided for in Article 77, third-country resolution proceedings relating to a Union subsidiary undertaking or a Union branch of a third-country undertaking or a parent undertaking.\n\nThe decision shall give due consideration to the interests of each Member State where a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking or parent undertaking operates, and in particular to the potential impact of the recognition and enforcement of the third-country resolution proceedings on the other parts of the group and on the policy holders, the real economy and the financial stability in those Member States.\n\n3.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities are, as a minimum, empowered to do the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nexercise the resolution powers in relation to the following:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nassets of a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking or parent undertaking that are located in their Member State or governed by the law of their Member State;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nrights or liabilities of a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking that are booked by the Union branch of a third-country undertaking in their Member State or governed by the law of their Member State, or where claims in relation to such rights and liabilities are enforceable in their Member State;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nperfect, including to require another person to take action to perfect, a transfer of shares or other instruments of ownership in a Union subsidiary undertaking established in that Member State;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nexercise the powers in Article 49, 50 or 51 in relation to the rights of any party to a contract with an entity referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, where such powers are necessary in order to enforce third-country resolution proceedings; and\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nrender unenforceable any right to terminate or accelerate contracts, or affect the contractual rights, of entities referred to in paragraph 2 and of other group entities, where such a right arises from resolution action taken in respect of the third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, the parent undertaking of such entities, or other group entities, whether taken by the third-country resolution authority itself or otherwise pursuant to legal or regulatory requirements concerning resolution arrangements in that country, provided that the substantive obligations under the contract, including payment and delivery obligations, and provision of collateral, continue to be performed.\n\n4.   Resolution authorities may take, where necessary in the public interest, resolution action with respect to a parent undertaking where the relevant third-country authority determines that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking of that parent undertaking and that is incorporated in that third country meets the conditions for resolution under the law of that third country. To that end, Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities are empowered to use any resolution power in respect of that parent undertaking, and Article 48 shall apply.\n\n5.   The recognition and enforcement of third-country resolution proceedings shall be without prejudice to any normal insolvency proceedings under national law applicable, where appropriate, in accordance with this Directive.\n\nArticle 77\n\nRight to refuse recognition or enforcement of third-country resolution proceedings\n\nThe resolution authority may refuse to recognise or to enforce third-country resolution proceedings pursuant to Article 76 if it considers:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthat the third-country resolution proceedings would have adverse effects on financial stability in the Member State in which the resolution authority is based or that the proceedings would have adverse effects on financial stability in another Member State;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthat independent resolution action under Article 78 in relation to a Union branch of a third-country undertaking is necessary to achieve one or more of the resolution objectives;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthat creditors would not receive the same treatment as third-country creditors with similar legal rights under the third-country home resolution proceedings;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthat recognition or enforcement of the third-country resolution proceedings would have material fiscal implications for the Member State; or\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthat the effects of such recognition or enforcement would be contrary to the national law.\n\nArticle 78\n\nResolution of Union branches of third-country undertakings\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the powers necessary to act in relation to a Union branch of a third-country undertaking that is not subject to any third-country resolution proceedings or that is subject to third-country proceedings and one of the circumstances referred to in Article 77 applies.\n\nMember States shall ensure that Article 48 applies to the exercise of such powers.\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the powers required in paragraph 1 may be exercised by resolution authorities where the resolution authority considers that action is necessary in the public interest and one or more of the following conditions is met:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe Union branch of a third-country undertaking no longer meets, or is likely not to meet, the conditions imposed by national law for its authorisation and operation within that Member State and there is no prospect that any private sector, supervisory or relevant third-country action would restore the branch to compliance or prevent failure in a reasonable timeframe;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking is, in the opinion of the resolution authority, unable or unwilling, or is likely to be unable, to pay its obligations to Union creditors, or obligations that have been created or booked through the branch, such as payments to policy holders or beneficiaries, as they fall due and the resolution authority is satisfied that no third-country resolution proceedings or insolvency proceedings have been or will be initiated in relation to that third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking in a reasonable timeframe;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe relevant third-country authority has initiated third-country resolution proceedings in relation to the third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, or has notified to the resolution authority its intention to initiate such a proceeding.\n\n3.   Where a resolution authority takes an independent action in relation to a Union branch of a third-country undertaking, it shall have regard to the resolution objectives and take the action in accordance with the following principles and requirements, insofar as they are relevant:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe principles set out in Article 22;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe requirements relating to the application of the resolution tools in Title III, Chapter II.\n\nArticle 79\n\nCooperation with third-country authorities\n\n1.   This Article shall apply in respect of cooperation with a third country unless and until an international agreement as referred to in Article 75(1) enters into force with the relevant third country. It shall also apply following the entry into force of such an international agreement to the extent that the subject matter of this Article is not governed by that agreement.\n\n2.   EIOPA may conclude non-binding framework cooperation arrangements with relevant third-country authorities. The framework cooperation agreements shall establish processes and arrangements between the participating authorities for sharing information necessary for and cooperation in carrying out some or all or the following tasks and exercising some or all of the following powers in relation to insurance or reinsurance undertakings or groups:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe development of resolution plans in

Article 141 of Directive 2009/138/EC and similar powers under the law of the relevant third countries;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe application of resolution tools and exercise of resolution powers and similar powers exercisable by the relevant third-country authorities.\n\n3.   Supervisory or resolution authorities, where appropriate, may conclude cooperation arrangements with relevant third-country authorities in line with the EIOPA framework arrangement referred to in paragraph 2.\n\n4.   Member States shall notify EIOPA of any cooperation arrangements that resolution authorities and supervisory authorities have concluded in accordance with this Article.\n\nArticle 80\n\nExchange of confidential information\n\n1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities, supervisory authorities and competent ministries exchange confidential information, including pre-emptive recovery plans, with relevant third-country authorities only if the following conditions are met:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthose third-country authorities are subject to requirements and standards of professional secrecy at least considered to be equivalent, in the opinion of all the authorities concerned, to those imposed by Article 66.\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe information is necessary for the performance by the relevant third-country authorities of their resolution functions under national law that are comparable to those under this Directive and, subject to point (a), is not used for any other purposes.\n\nFor the purposes of point (a), insofar as the exchange of information relates to personal data, the handling and transmission of such personal data to third-country authorities shall be governed by the applicable Union and national data-protection law.\n\n2.   Where confidential information originates in another Member State, resolution authorities, supervisory authorities and competent ministries shall not disclose that information to relevant third-country authorities unless the following conditions are met:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe relevant authority of the Member State where the information originated (the originating authority) agrees to that

reinsurance undertakings authorised in that Member State and from Union branches of third-country undertakings located in the territory of that Member State to cover at least the payment of the difference to shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants or other creditors referred to in Article 57.\n\nMember States may provide for the possibility to use financing arrangements referred to in the first subparagraph also to cover other costs associated with the use of resolution tools, insofar as the use of financing arrangements is necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives.\n\nMember States may use the same administrative structure for their financing arrangements as for their insurance guarantee schemes, taking into account Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26).\n\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the use of financing arrangements complies with the principles laid down in Article 22.\n\n3.   Where the undertaking under resolution operates within the Union under the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services, the relevant financing arrangement of the Member State in which the undertaking is authorised shall be used to provide compensation to shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants or other creditors in accordance with Article 57.\n\n4.   Member States shall notify the Commission and EIOPA of the established financing arrangements.\n\nTITLE VI\n\nPENALTIES\n\nArticle 82\n\nAdministrative penalties and other administrative measures\n\n1.   Without prejudice to the powers of resolution and supervisory authorities laid down in this Directive and Directive 2009/138/EC and the right of Member States to provide for and impose criminal penalties, Member States shall lay down rules on administrative penalties and other administrative measures applicable where the national provisions transposing this Directive have not been complied with, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.\n\nMember States that decide not to lay down rules for administrative penalties or other administrative measures for infringements which are subject to national criminal law shall communicate to the Commission the criminal law provisions concerned.\n\nThe administrative penalties

    "texte": "REGULATION (EU) 2025/14 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\nof 19 December 2024\n\non the approval and market surveillance of non-road mobile machinery circulating on public roads and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1020\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nSelf-propelled mobile machinery, falling within the scope of Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), that is designed or constructed with the purpose to perform work (‘non-road mobile machinery’), might need, whether occasionally or regularly, to circulate on public roads, mostly to move from one working place to another.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation covers only self-propelled machinery. Towed machinery equipment is not covered by this Regulation because such equipment is normally towed by motor vehicles falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). Such equipment should be covered by Regulation (EU) 2018/858, which regulates the type-approval of motor vehicles including their trailers. The Commission should address the need to establish, under Regulation (EU) 2018/858, detailed technical requirements relating to the road safety of the specific category of towed machinery equipment, insofar as such equipment is not subject to such requirements under the existing rules.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nCertain aspects of the design and construction of non-road mobile machinery are already covered by Union harmonisation legislation, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), Directive 2000/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), Directive 2006/42/EC, and Directives 2014/30/EU (7) and 2014/53/EU (8) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nAs regards the safety of mobile machinery, Directive 2006/42/EC is the main regulatory act applying to that machinery when placed on the market. It sets out essential health and safety requirements covering the off-road travelling functions of mobile machinery such as slowing down, stopping, braking, driving positions and restraint systems. However, the essential health and safety requirements set out in that Directive are only designed to address safety when the machinery is at work, and do not cover the safety aspects of that machinery when circulating on public roads.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nDue to the absence of harmonised rules on the road safety of non-road mobile machinery, economic operators that produce, or make available on the market, non-road mobile machinery face significant costs associated with differing regulatory requirements across the Members States. In addition, the road safety of that machinery is not ensured uniformly in the whole territory of the Union. Therefore, it is necessary to establish harmonised rules at Union level with respect to the road safety of non-road mobile machinery.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nFor the purposes of the development and operation of the internal market, it is appropriate to establish a harmonised type-approval system and an individual approval system for the road safety of non-road mobile machinery intended to circulate on public roads.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nThe objective of this Regulation is to address the risks associated with the intended circulation of non-road mobile machinery on public roads. Thus, non-road mobile machinery that, in practice, is not intended to circulate on public roads should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nSince the purpose of this Regulation is to address the risks stemming from the road circulation of non-road mobile machinery designed and constructed for performing work and not for the transport of persons, animals or goods, except insofar as it carries materials that contribute to its operation, this Regulation should not apply to machinery the only objective of which is the transport of persons, animals or goods. All types of new personal mobility devices, such as stand-up and seated e-scooters, electrically assisted pedal cycles including electrically power-assisted cycles and those intended for carrying commercial cargo, self-balancing vehicles including self-balancing personal transporters and hoverboards, electric unicycles, electric skateboards and ‘one-wheel’ boards, are therefore not subject to this Regulation.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nSince the purpose of this Regulation is to address road circulation of non-road mobile machinery designed and constructed for performing work, and not to transport workers, mobile machinery which is equipped with more than three seating positions, including the driver’s seating position, is also excluded from the scope of this Regulation. Any space should be considered as a seating position if it is designed for use when the non-road mobile machinery is circulating on public roads and can be reasonably used as such and it allows a fifth percentile adult female to be seated.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should cover only non-road mobile machinery intended to circulate on public roads and that is placed on the market from the date of application of this Regulation and is either new non-road mobile machinery produced by a manufacturer established in the Union or non-road mobile machinery, whether new or second-hand, imported from a third country.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should apply to non-road mobile machinery intended to circulate on public roads irrespective of its propulsion system and, therefore, should also apply to electric and hybrid machinery. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the electric safety requirements related to electric drives laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nSlow non-road mobile machinery represents the majority of the non-road mobile machinery market. In addition, some Member States have established a road circulation speed limit for non-road mobile machinery of 40 km/h. Moreover, as road safety risks are proportional to road speed, it would not be coherent for a framework that addresses safety risks only for non-road mobile machinery and not for regular vehicles to cover either fast non-road mobile machinery or non-road mobile machinery not exceeding 6 km/h. This Regulation should therefore not apply to mobile machinery with a maximum design speed not exceeding 6 km/h or exceeding 40 km/h.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nIn some specific well defined cases, manufacturers should have a choice to use national schemes, EU type-approval or EU individual approval. Given the particularities of prototypes of non-road mobile machinery intended to be used on the road under the responsibility of the manufacturer to carry out specific development test programmes or field tests, non-road mobile machinery designed and constructed or adapted for use by civil protection, fire services and forces responsible for maintaining public order and non-road mobile machinery used primarily in quarries or at airports, it is appropriate to allow manufacturers’ flexibility regarding the approval scheme they apply for.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nThis can also be the case for small and medium sized enterprises producing non-road mobile machinery in numbers of units that are made available on the market, registered or entered into service not exceeding, per year and in each Member State, 70 units per type.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nThough Member States will be able to establish national schemes for the non-road mobile machinery described in recitals 13 and 14, Member States that have not established such a scheme should require manufacturers, for that non-road mobile machinery, to comply with this Regulation. In addition, the Member States that have established such a scheme should allow manufacturers to choose to comply with this Regulation in order to benefit from free movement.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nGiven that, in certain instances, non-road mobile machinery, due to its excessive dimensions, would not allow for sufficient manoeuvrability on public roads or could, due to its excessive mass, axle loads or ground contact pressure, damage the surface of public roads or other road infrastructure, or due to its fully automated driving systems for on-road use, it is appropriate to provide a discretion to Member States to prohibit the circulation on public roads or registration of such machinery, even if it has been type-approved in accordance with this Regulation. In order to ensure a high level of harmonisation for non-road mobile machinery across the Union, it is important that Member States only prohibit the circulation on public roads of a limited number of machines. Therefore, both the Member States and the Commission should set sufficiently high threshold values to allow as many type-approved machines as possible to circulate on public roads in the territory of the Union.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to minimise the risk of injury to persons and of damage to road infrastructure while non-road mobile machinery is circulating on public roads, technical requirements should be set out. The technical requirements should include subjects relating to road safety such as vehicle structure integrity, maximum design speed, speed governor, speed limitation devices and speedometer, braking devices, steering, field of vision, and masses and dimensions. The technical requirements should take into account synergies between the machinery function and the on-road use function of the non-road mobile machinery. In order to keep those technical requirements sufficiently future-proof, the Commission can lay down rules for additional requirements due to technical and scientific progress, such as driver assistance systems and automated and remotely operated driving systems.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden for economic operators, this Regulation should allow for the use of components and separate technical units in non-road mobile machinery that have been type-approved in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) or with Regulation (EU) 2018/858.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market non-road mobile machinery which is in conformity with this Regulation. It is therefore necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nWith a view to ensuring that the procedure for monitoring conformity of production, which is one of the cornerstones of the EU type-approval system, has been correctly implemented and functions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by the competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service designated for that purpose. The sampling rate for such checks should be proportionate to the production volumes concerned. Member States should ensure that their approval authorities and market surveillance authorities have the necessary resources, such as sufficient budgetary, human and material resources, including a sufficient number of competent personnel, as well as sufficient expertise, procedures and other arrangements in place to exercise the powers that are conferred on them under Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on market surveillance and control of products entering the market provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 apply to non-road mobile machinery covered by this Regulation and, in relation to the aspects addressed or covered by the technical requirements laid down in this Regulation, amend Annex I to that Regulation in order to list, in that Annex, the references for this Regulation.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nFor non-road mobile machinery, there should be an economic operator established in the Union to whom market surveillance authorities can address requests, including requests for information regarding a product’s compliance with this Regulation, and who can cooperate with market surveillance authorities in making sure that immediate corrective action is taken to remedy instances of non-compliance. The economic operators who should perform those tasks are the manufacturer or an authorised representative mandated by the manufacturer for that purpose. The manufacturer should ensure that a mandated authorised representative is appointed at all times during the period the manufacturer holds an EU type-approval or an EU individual approval in accordance with this Regulation.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the EU type-approval and EU individual approval procedure and certain administrative provisions of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nCloser coordination between national authorities through information exchange and coordinated assessments under the direction of a coordinating authority is fundamental in order to ensure a consistently high level of health and safety within the internal market. It also leads to more efficient use of scarce resources at national level. For this purpose, an advisory forum for exchange of information on enforcement should be established for Member States and the Commission with the objective of promoting best practices, exchanging information and coordinating activities related to the enforcement of this Regulation. Given the establishment of such a forum and considering its tasks, it should not be necessary to establish a separate administrative cooperation group as required by Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. However, the forum should be considered as an administrative cooperation group for the purposes of the Union Product Compliance Network referred to in Article 29 of that Regulation.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to supplement this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of: the methodology for the determination of the threshold values that may be applied in relation to the excessive dimensions and mass, axle loads or ground contact pressure of non-road mobile machinery; the applicability of the elements of the technical requirements; the laying down of detailed technical requirements, test procedures and test methods; virtual testing; and the arrangements with regard to conformity of production and for specifying rules in relation to technical services. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations are conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (13). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of this Regulation and, based on information provided by Member States, reconsider, if needed, the question of whether to submit an exclusive legislative proposal or extend the transitional period for the national type-approval.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to enable Member States and national authorities as well as economic operators to prepare for the application of the new rules introduced by this Regulation, a date of application falling after the date of its entry into force should be set. It is also necessary to provide for a transitional period allowing manufacturers, during that period, to comply with this Regulation and benefit from free movement or to comply with the relevant national type-approval legislation.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nWith a view to facilitating the implementation of the harmonised provisions of this Regulation after its entry into force, Member States should refrain, during the transitional period, from adopting new national technical regulations for the approval of non-road mobile machinery circulating on public roads that are not aligned with those established in this Regulation. The transitional period should apply only for those Member States that have in place, during that period, any existing or new national technical regulations for the approval of non-road mobile machinery circulating on public roads.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). Accordingly, this Regulation should be interpreted and applied with respect to those rights and principles, in particular the right to respect for private and family life, which includes the right to respect for one’s home, in accordance with Article 7 of the Charter.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely laying down harmonised technical requirements, administrative requirements and procedures for the EU type-approval and the EU individual approval of new non-road mobile machinery intended to circulate on public roads, as well as the rules and procedures for the market surveillance of such machinery, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS

The assessment report shall be reviewed at least every 3 years.\n\n3.   The assessment report shall be communicated to the Commission upon request. In such cases, where the assessment is not based on an accreditation certificate issued by a national accreditation body attesting that the technical service fulfils the requirements laid down in this Regulation, the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission with documentary evidence which attests the technical service’s competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that the technical service is monitored regularly by the designating approval authority and satisfies the requirements laid down in this Regulation and the acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n4.   The approval authority that intends to be designated as a technical service in accordance with Article 40(2) shall document compliance through an assessment conducted by auditors independent of the activity being assessed. Such auditors may be from the same organisation provided that they are managed separately from personnel undertaking the assessed activity.\n\n5.   An accredited in-house technical service shall comply with the relevant provisions of this Article.\n\nArticle 44\n\nProcedures for notification\n\n1.   Member States shall notify the Commission of the name, postal and email addresses, responsible persons and category of activities of each technical service they have designated, as well as any subsequent modifications to those designations. That notification shall state for which elements listed in Article 16(2) or any other element specified in delegated acts referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph the technical services have been designated.\n\n2.   A technical service may conduct the activities referred to in Article 40(1) on behalf of the designating approval authority responsible for the type-approval only if it has been notified beforehand to the Commission in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n3.   The technical service referred to in paragraph 2 may be designated by several designating approval authorities and notified by the Member States of those designating approval authorities irrespective of the category or categories of activities it will conduct in accordance with Article 40(1).\n\n4.   Member States shall notify the Commission of any subsequent relevant changes to the designation.\n\n5.   Where a specific organisation or competent body carrying out an activity not included in those referred to in Article 40(1), needs to be designated in accordance with the acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, the notification shall be made in accordance with this Article.\n\n6.   The Commission shall publish on its website a list and details of the technical services notified in accordance with this Article.\n\nArticle 45\n\nChanges to designations\n\n1.   Where an approval authority has ascertained or has been informed that a technical service designated by it no longer meets the requirements laid down in this Regulation, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the designating approval authority shall restrict, suspend or withdraw the designation as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations, and inform that technical service thereof. The Member State that has notified that technical service shall immediately inform the Commission accordingly. The Commission shall modify the information published referred to in Article 44(6) accordingly.\n\n2.   In the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of the designation, or where the technical service has ceased its activity, the designating approval authority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that technical service are either processed by another technical service or kept available for the designating approval authority or for the market surveillance authorities at their request.\n\nArticle 46\n\nChallenge to the competence of technical services\n\n1.   The Commission shall investigate all cases where it has doubts, or doubt is brought to its attention, regarding the competence of a technical service or the continued fulfilment by a technical service of the requirements and responsibilities to which it is subject.\n\n2.   The Member State of the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all information relating to the basis for the designation or the maintenance of the designation of the technical service concerned.\n\n3.   The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its investigations is treated confidentially.\n\n4.   Where the Commission ascertains that a technical service does not comply or no longer complies with the requirements for its designation, it shall inform the Member State of the designating approval authority accordingly.\n\nThe Commission shall request that Member State to restrict, suspend or withdraw the designation, where necessary.\n\nWhere a Member State fails to take the necessary corrective measures, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to decide to restrict, suspend or withdraw the designation of the technical service concerned. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(2). The Commission shall notify the Member State concerned of those implementing acts and shall update the information published referred to in Article 44(6) accordingly.\n\nArticle 47\n\nOperational obligations of technical services\n\n1.   Technical services shall carry out the categories of activities for which they have been designated on behalf of the designating approval authority and in accordance with the assessment and test procedures provided for in this Regulation.\n\n2.   Technical services shall supervise or shall themselves carry out the tests required for approval or inspections as set out in this Regulation. The technical services shall not conduct tests, assessments or inspections for which they have not been duly designated by their approval authority.\n\n3.   Technical services shall at all times:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nallow their designating approval authority to witness the technical service during the conformity assessment as appropriate; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwithout prejudice to Article 38(10) and Article 48, provide their designating approval authority with information on their categories of activities falling under the scope of this Regulation as may be requested.\n\n4.   Where a technical service finds that requirements laid down in this Regulation have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall report this to the designating approval authority so that the designating approval authority requires the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and subsequently refrain from issuing an EU type-approval certificate unless the appropriate corrective measures have been taken to the satisfaction of the approval authority.\n\n5.   Where, in the course of monitoring the conformity of production following the issuance of an EU type-approval certificate, a technical service acting on behalf of the designating approval authority finds that non-road mobile machinery is no longer in conformity with this Regulation, it shall report that finding to the designating approval authority. The approval authority shall take the appropriate measures as provided for in Article 23.\n\nArticle 48\n\nInformation obligations of technical services\n\n1.   Technical services shall inform their designating approval authority of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nany non-conformity encountered which may require a refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of an EU type-approval certificate;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nany circumstances affecting the scope of, and conditions for, their designation;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nany request for information which they have received from market surveillance authorities regarding their activities.\n\n2.   On request from their designating approval authority, technical services shall provide information on the activities within the scope of their designation and on any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and subcontracting.\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIMPLEMENTING ACTS AND DELEGATED ACTS\n\nArticle 49\n\nCommittee procedure\n\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Technical Committee – Agricultural Vehicles (TC-AV), established by Regulation (EU) No 167/2013. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n\n3.   Where the committee delivers no opinion, the Commission shall not adopt the draft implementing act and Article 5(4), third subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n\nArticle 50\n\nExercise of the delegation\n\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n\n2.   The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 5(6), Article 16(2), Article 22(9), Article 23(6) and Article 42 shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 5 years from 28 January 2025. The Commission shall draw up a report in respect of the delegation of power not later than 9 months before the end of that 5-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than 3 months before the end of each period.\n\n3.   The delegation of power referred to in Article 5(6), Article 16(2), Article 22(9), Article 23(6) and Article 42 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\n\n4.   Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.\n\n5.   As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n6.   A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 5(6), Article 16(2), Article 22(9), Article 23(6) or Article 42 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or by the Council within a period of 2 months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\n\n7.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts as referred to in Article 5(6), Article 16(2), Article 22(9), Article 23(6) and Article 42 before 29 January 2027.\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 51\n\nAmendment to Regulation (EU) 2019/1020\n\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the following point is added:\n\n‘72.\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) 2025/14 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2024 on the approval and market surveillance of non-road mobile machinery circulating on public roads and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 (OJ L, 2025/14, 8.1.2025, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/14/oj).’\n\nArticle 52\n\nForum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement\n\n1.   The Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement (‘the Forum’) established by the Commission in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 shall consider:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nmatters related to the uniform interpretation of the requirements laid down in this Regulation;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe results of the activities relating to type-approval and market surveillance;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nmatters of general relevance with regard to the implementation of the requirements laid down in this Regulation in relation to the assessment, designation and monitoring of technical services;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\ninfringements by economic operators;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nimplementation of the corrective or restrictive measures laid down in Chapter X;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthe planning, coordination and results of market surveillance activities.\n\n2.   Article 11(1), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

The manufacturer assumes the responsibility for the conformity of the product with such declared performance and with applicable requirements. Manufacturers are exempted from this obligation for certain products.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nExperience with the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, the evaluation conducted by the Commission in 2019 as well as the report on the European Organisation for Technical Assessment have shown the underperformance of the framework on construction products in various respects, including as regards the development of standards and the market surveillance. In addition, feedback received in the course of the evaluation has pointed to the need of reducing the overlaps, removing contradictions and repetitive requirements, including in relation to other Union legislation, in order to provide more legal clarity and limit the administrative burden on the economic operators. It is therefore necessary to update and align legal obligations of economic operators with those provided for in other Union legislation, as well as to add new provisions including as regards market surveillance, so that legal certainty is increased and that diverging interpretations are avoided.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to establish well-functioning information flows, including via electronic means and using a machine-readable format, to ensure that coherent and transparent information about construction products performances is available along the supply chain. This is expected to increase transparency and to improve efficiency in terms of information transfer. Ensuring digital access to comprehensive information about construction products would contribute to the digitalisation of the construction sector altogether, making the framework fit for the digital age. Moreover, providing access to reliable and durable information would also mean that economic operators and other actors would not contribute to each other’s non-compliance with requirements.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nThe European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2021 on the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products (the Construction Products Regulation) (4) welcomed the Commission’s objective to make the construction sector more sustainable by addressing the sustainability performance of construction products in the revision of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, as announced in Commission’s communication of 11 March 2020 entitled ‘A new Circular Economy Action Plan. For a cleaner and more competitive Europe’. The Council Conclusions on the Circular Economy in the Construction Sector of 28 November 2019 urged the Commission to facilitate the circularity of construction products when revising Regulation (EU) No 305/2011. In its Communication of 10 March 2020 entitled ‘A New Industrial Strategy for Europe’ the Commission emphasised the need to address the sustainability of construction products and highlighted a more sustainable built environment as essential for Europe’s transition towards climate-neutrality. In its Communication of 5 May 2021 entitled ‘Updating the 2020 New Industrial Strategy: Building a stronger Single Market for Europe’s recovery’ the Commission identified construction as one of the priority ecosystems that face the most important challenges meeting climate and sustainability goals and embracing the digital transformation, and on which the competitiveness of the construction sector depends. It is therefore appropriate to lay down rules for declaring environmental sustainability performance of construction products, including the possibility of establishing relevant threshold levels and classes. Classes of performance for the environmental performance of products should accurately reflect the diversity of products and their state of the art and should allow for the most environmentally friendly products to be accurately identified. Moreover, when referring to environmental impacts, such classes of performance should be understandable, should not be misleading, nor allow for burden shifting.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nSimilarly, the 2022 EU Strategy on Standardisation set out in the Commission Communication of 2 February 2022, entitled ‘An EU Strategy on Standardisation – Setting global standards in support of a resilient, green and digital EU single market’ identified construction as one of the most pertinent areas where harmonised standards could improve competitiveness and reduce market barriers.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nPursuing the environmental goals, including the fight against climate change and the transition towards a circular economy, makes it necessary to establish, without increasing disproportionately bureaucracy and costs for economic operators, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’), new environmental obligations and to lay the ground for the development and the application of an assessment method for the calculation of the environmental sustainability of construction products. The calculations should cover the life cycle of the product using the methods established through standardisation. For new products the calculated life cycles should include all stages of a product’s life, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources, to its final disposal, including potential benefits and loads outside the boundary limits. For used and remanufactured products, the calculated life cycle should start with the deinstallation from a construction work and should include all following stages until final disposal. The Commission should make available software to perform the calculation, in particular the characterisation factors applicable in accordance with European standard EN 15804 or future applicable standards. Any update of this software should be communicated and should trigger the update to the relevant calculations within one year.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure safety and functionality of construction products and, by extension, of construction works as well as safety of workers and users, it is necessary to ensure that certain service providers, such as fulfilment service providers, online marketplaces and actors providing intermediary services, do not contribute to the non-compliance of other actors. It is therefore necessary to render relevant provisions applicable also to these services and their providers.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nTo create the necessary link between construction products and the construction works, including buildings, into which they might be incorporated, the notion of construction works should be defined only for the purposes of this Regulation and without prejudice to Member States’ competences to define and regulate construction works and buildings.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to avoid innovative distribution models being used to circumvent the obligations under this Regulation, it should be clarified that any supply of a product in the course of a commercial activity, including when ownership or possession of the products is transferred as part of the provision of a service, would be considered as the product being made available on the market.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nEnsuring the free movement of kits for construction products on the internal market would support industry competitiveness. This approach would expand market reach, streamline production processes for companies, and improve convenience for both consumers and businesses.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nThe compliance of construction products with Union legislation often depends on the compliance of their key parts with that legislation. However, since key parts are often integrated into various construction products, ensuring safety and the protection of the environment, including climate, would be better achieved if those key parts were assessed upstream, that is if their performance and conformity were assessed beforehand and independently from the assessment of the final construction product into which they are integrated. Similarly, market surveillance would be more efficient if non-compliant key parts could be identified and targeted. Therefore, it is necessary to lay down mandatory rules applicable to key parts of construction products. The same approach should be used for parts or materials intended to be used for construction products which would benefit from the voluntary application of the Regulation.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nItems, such as construction products, their key parts or other parts or materials, can be placed on the market as such or as a set of separate components intended to be used together and should be subject to dedicated harmonised technical specifications. To simplify the application of this Regulation, the items and components falling under its scope should be clearly identified. However, such identification should not preclude the possibility to market the components as construction products when these components are placed on the market separately, as key parts or otherwise.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nWhile keeping a broad scope for the possible application of this Regulation, its application to certain products already harmonised by other Union legal acts should be excluded to avoid regulatory overlap. For the same purpose, it is also important to distinguish between those aspects of the same products which are covered by this Regulation and those aspects which are regulated by other sectorial legislation. This would be the case, for example, for lighting products and electrical and electronic products, which are subject to Directives 2014/35/EU (5), 2014/30/EU (6), 2014/53/EU (7) and 2001/95/EC (8) of the European Parliament and of the Council. The broad scope of this Regulation should however not be interpreted as an intention to harmonise all products which can be placed on the market for incorporation into construction works. Products which are not suitable for harmonisation, for instance due to their relation to cultural heritage, their usage of specific materials which can only be sourced in certain localities or to heterogeneous conditions between Member States, should not be subject to the harmonising effect of this Regulation. This could be achieved through the active choice of not pursuing their coverage through harmonised technical specifications.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nUsed products subject to this Regulation imported from third countries, should, in the absence of dedicated rules for used products, be subject to the same rules as new construction products.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nConstruction products placed on the market in the outermost regions of the Union are often imported from neighbouring countries, and are therefore not subject to requirements laid down in Union law. Subjecting those construction products to such requirements would be disproportionately costly. At the same time, construction products manufactured in the outermost regions hardly circulate in other Member States. Therefore, Member States should have the possibility to exempt construction products placed on the market in the outermost regions of the Union from those requirements.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure that a strong link between standards and the regulatory needs of the Member States is maintained, an expert group should support the Commission in the preparation of standardisation requests and other harmonised technical specifications. The work of the expert group should follow a working plan established on the basis of inputs from Member States in addition to overall Union priorities such as EU climate and circular economy goals. In establishing the priorities of the working plan, the Commission should pay particular attention to the replacement of harmonised technical specifications adopted under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011. The Commission should inform the Member States and the European Parliament on a yearly basis about progress in implementing the working plan, including information on the standardisation requests issued, the number of standards proposed by the European standardisation organisations, the average time needed for the assessment of standards by the Commission, and the ratio between standards accepted and rejected by the Commission.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of harmonising the internal market for construction products to address the regulatory needs of Member States by defining only the necessary essential characteristics to assess the product performance. The definition of these essential characteristics and the assessment methods applicable to them should provide the less onerous approach with sufficient reliability and avoid duplications and inconsistencies. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective, in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to strive for a maximum of regulatory coherence, this Regulation should to the extent possible build on the horizontal legal framework, in this case namely on Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). It follows the recent trend in product legislation to develop a fall-back solution where the European standardisation organisations do not deliver valid harmonised standards. When a European standardisation organisation delivers a harmonised standard in accordance with the standardisation request which includes elements that do not satisfy the regulatory needs of Member States, or are not aligned with the Union safety, environmental, circularity and climate objectives, the Commission should revise the standardisation request or make the harmonised standard mandatory with restrictions. A fall-back solution should be possible to apply to harmonised standards which are not compliant with the standardisation request and address a product family or product category which is either not previously covered by a harmonised standard, or is already covered by a harmonised standard applicable for more than 5 years, or is covered by a harmonised standard applicable with restrictions.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nWhere harmonised standards lay down the rules for the assessment of performance with regard to essential characteristics relevant for the construction codes of Member States, those standards should be made mandatory for the purposes of application of this Regulation as performance harmonised standards, as only such mandatory standards reach the goal of permitting the free circulation of products, whilst ensuring the Member States’ ability to request product characteristics related to the basic requirements for construction works in view of their specific national situation such as differences in climate, geology and geography and other conditions. When pursued together, these two goals require that products are assessed by a single assessment method, therefore the method needs to be mandatory. However, voluntary standards can be used to make product requirements, specified for the relevant product family or product category by delegated acts, even more concrete, following the path of Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). In line with Decision No 768/2008/EC, those voluntary standards should be able to provide a presumption of conformity with the requirements covered by them.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nThe assessment of performance with regard to essential characteristics may require the establishment of threshold levels. Voluntary threshold levels have to be fulfilled in relation to certain applications. Mandatory threshold levels have to be fulfilled as a condition for placing the product on the internal market irrespective of its application.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal set out in Commission’s communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’, the Circular Economy Action Plan and the Zero Pollution Action Plan set out in Commission’s communication of 12 May 2021 entitled ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All. EU Action Plan: “Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil”’, and to ensure safe construction products, safety being one of the goals to be pursued in the legislation based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), product requirements related to functionality, safety, and protection of environment, including climate, are necessary. When setting these requirements, the Commission should address the safety risks and take into account the product’s potential contribution to achieving Union climate, environmental and energy efficiency objectives over the course of their life cycle. Those requirements do not relate to the performance of construction products. Contrary to its predecessor Council Directive 89/106/EEC (11), Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 does not provide for the possibility to establish such product requirements. However, certain harmonised standards for construction products contain such product requirements. Those standards demonstrate that there is a practical need for such requirements on functionality, safety, and protection of environment. Article 114 TFEU as the legal basis of this Regulation also imposes the pursuit of a high level of health, safety and protection of the environment. Thus, this Regulation should reintroduce or validate product requirements. Hence, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to specify those requirements for the respective product family or product category.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nManufacturing and distribution of construction products becomes ever more complex, leading to the emergence of new specialised operators, such as fulfilment service providers. For reasons of clarity, certain generic obligations, including on cooperation with authorities, should be applicable to all those involved in the supply chain.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to foster harmonised practices amongst Member States even where a consensus about these practices could not be found, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, with regard to a limited range of issues, implementing acts on the implementation of this Regulation. The respective empowerments should concern the obligations and rights of economic operators and the obligations of notified bodies.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to improve the legal certainty and to mitigate the fragmentation of the Union market for construction products it is necessary to clearly define the area regulated at Union level, the so-called ‘harmonised zone’, as opposed to the elements remaining within the competence of Member States. Member States remain competent to lay down provisions on construction works, including on their design and dimensioning. The establishment of the harmonised zone should not affect the right of Member States to specify national requirements on construction works and should not reduce the level of protection already existing and justified in the Member States. National environmental policies applicable to construction works should not be considered as prohibitions or barriers to the making available of products on the market as long as they respect the harmonised zone.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nMember States set the safety level for construction works on the basis of their responsibilities towards their citizens, while the Union determines the framework conditions for the internal market. The competence to adopt provisions on construction works remains with the Member States. The basic requirements for construction works set out in this Regulation should establish the links to construction products that are technically necessary, and serve as a basis for issuing standardisation requests to the European standardisation organisations for the development of harmonised standards for construction products, corresponding delegated acts as well as for the development of European assessment documents.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nThe harmonised zone should also apply to public contracts, grants or other positive incentives with the exception of fiscal incentives.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to strike a balance between mitigating the fragmentation of the market and the legitimate interests of Member States to regulate construction works, it is necessary to provide for a mechanism to better reflect the needs of the Member States in the development of harmonised technical specifications. For the same reason, an additional mechanism of prior authorisation should be established, allowing Member States to set, based on imperative grounds of health and safety of persons or of protection of the environment, requirements other than those laid down in the harmonised technical specifications for products covered by the harmonised zone. This mechanism should give Member States the possibility, while awaiting updated harmonised technical specifications addressing their regulatory needs, to notify and seek authorisation for national measures affecting the performance of an essential characteristic not addressed by the harmonised technical specification. This mechanism should be complementary to a Member State’s possibility to notify the Commission, in accordance with Article 114 TFEU, when it deems it necessary to introduce national provisions based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State in contradiction with harmonised technical specifications. In order to ensure that authorised national measures only remain as temporary deviations from the harmonised zone, it is important to enable swift consultations on the need to update harmonised technical specifications in light of those regulatory needs, including, where appropriate, through standardisation requests with deadlines specifically set to address the urgency at hand.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nA circular economy, the key element of the Circular Economy Action Plan, can be promoted by mandatory deposit-refund systems and the obligation of manufacturers to regain ownership of new, surplus or unsold non-custom made products. Member States should therefore be allowed to take such measures and to establish obligations regarding the collection and the treatment of products for waste. The owner of the product should be in charge of the transport back to the distributor, importer or manufacturer.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to enhance legal clarity and reduce the administrative burden for the economic operators, it is necessary to avoid that construction products are subject to multiple assessments regarding the same aspect of health and safety of persons or protection of the environment, including climate, under different Union legal acts. This was confirmed by the REFIT platform, established by Commission Decision C(2015) 3261, recommending that the Commission gives priority to addressing the problems of overlapping and repetitive requirements. While not reducing or encroaching on the level of protection already existing and justified in Member States at construction level, the Commission should thus be able to determine the conditions under which the fulfilment of obligations provided for in other Union legal acts also fulfils certain obligations of this Regulation, where otherwise the same aspect of health and safety of persons or protection of the environment, including climate, would be assessed in parallel under this Regulation and other Union law.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nMoreover, in order to avoid diverging practices of Member States and economic operators, the power to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 291 TFEU should be granted to the Commission to determine whether certain items fall within the definition of product.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nAs this Regulation is developed in line with the framework of Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) but with its provisions adapted to the sectorial specificities of construction products, it will be, with limited exceptions, the legal act used for harmonising all relevant aspects of construction products, including sustainability aspects even though these might also be addressed through Regulation (EU) 2024/1781. If a policy need is identified horizontally within the framework of Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, the Commission should primarily use this Regulation for addressing this need in regard to construction products. Only in exceptional cases where requirements under this Regulation are insufficient and cannot be amended or complemented in a reasonable time, it should be possible to apply Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 in a complementary manner to construction products, provided the administrative cost entailed, including as a result of economic operators potentially becoming subject to two conformity assessment procedures, is shown to be reasonable. As an exception, in the case of energy-related products included in ecodesign working plans which are also construction products and for intermediate products within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, with the exception of cement, priority for the setting of sustainability requirements will be given to that Regulation. This will be the case for instance for heaters, boilers, heat pumps, water and space heating appliances, fans, cooling and ventilating systems and photovoltaic products, excluding building-integrated photovoltaic panels. This Regulation would still apply in a complementary manner where needed, mainly in relation to safety aspects also taking account of other Union legislation on products such as on gas appliances, low voltage, and machinery. In the case of a conflict with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, the relevant provisions of this Regulation should prevail. For other products, in order to avoid unnecessary burden for economic operators, the need may arise to determine the conditions under which the fulfilment of obligations under other Union law also fulfils certain obligations under this Regulation. Therefore the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to determine such conditions.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to create an incentive for compliance, the manufacturer of construction products should be liable for incorrect declarations of performance and conformity.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nThe increased reuse of construction products is part of a shift towards a more circular economy and a reduction of the environmental and carbon footprint of construction. The second-hand market for construction products is currently not very developed and requirements for construction products which have previously been used vary widely amongst Member States. Therefore, used construction products, including other used items subject to this Regulation, should be subject to long-term harmonisation by establishing the possibility to develop dedicated harmonised technical specifications under this Regulation. Such harmonised technical specifications should be applicable to used products and as long as the used product is not waste or has ceased to be waste. The adoption of dedicated harmonised technical specifications for used products should not prejudice the scope and definition of waste under Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). However, products directly reused in a construction work should not be considered as placed on the market again and therefore not be subject to any measures under this Regulation.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to provide clarity about the extent of the harmonised zone, it is important that all harmonised technical specifications are explicit in whether they cover or exclude used products from their scope. The exclusion of used products from the scope of a harmonised technical specification should however not prevent economic operators from opting for the application of this Regulation as if the used product was new.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nAccording to the definition of used products, harmonised technical specifications explicitly including used products within their scope should also apply to used products which have undergone a transformative process going beyond checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations defined by the harmonised technical specification as non-essential transformative processes to the product’s performance. Remanufactured products should, regardless of the harmonised technical specification, benefit from not having to include events before the product’s last deinstallation when calculating its environmental impact over its life cycle. Remanufactured products should also benefit from requirements or incentives that promote a high recycled content.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nTo enhance access to easily available and comprehensive information on construction products, thereby contributing to their safety, functionality and sustainability, it should be ensured that the declaration of performance and conformity provides all information necessary for users and authorities. In view of its utility for users, manufacturers should be able to include into that declaration additional information, provided that the declarations of performance and conformity remain uniform and easily readable and that they are not abused as advertisement.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to reduce the burden for economic operators, and in particular manufacturers, economic operators issuing declarations of performance and conformity should be allowed to provide copies of those declarations by electronic means, and be authorised to make them available on websites on the conditions that they are unamendable, human and machine readable, available, accessible and unequivocally linked to the product. In order to simplify supply chain communication, declarations of performance and conformity should allow the user – by means of an IT application – to check conformity with the application rules of the Member State where the product is used. An important prerequisite for machine-readable declarations is a standardised IT format, which is required for each harmonised technical specification.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nIn order for the manufacturers to demonstrate that the construction products benefitting from the free movement of goods fulfil relevant Union requirements, it is necessary to require a declaration of conformity complementing the declaration of performance, thus also bringing the regulatory system for construction products closer to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). However, in order to minimise the potential administrative burden, the declaration of conformity and the declaration of performance should be combined. The administrative burden on SMEs should be further minimised through targeted simplification provisions, including sharing test results, recognition of certificates, cascading of technical documentation and declaration without assessment, permitting micro-enterprises to use the more lenient assessment and verification system and reducing the requirements for custom-made non-series products. When such products are installed in an identified single construction work exemptions from the obligation to draw up a declaration of performance and conformity should be possible. In cases where a manufacturer fulfils the criteria for both the application of a simplified procedure and an exemption from the obligation to draw up a declaration of performance and conformity, it should be given the opportunity to choose one of them, or to provide a declaration of performance and conformity without applying the simplified procedure, so as to better adapt its offer to the needs of potential customers.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to reach alignment with other product legislation and subject to the general principles of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, the CE marking should be affixed only to construction products for which the manufacturer has drawn up a declaration of performance and conformity. The manufacturer thereby assumes the responsibility for the conformity of the product with the declared performance and the applicable product requirements.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nThe procedural rights of all economic operators and natural or legal persons acting on their behalf in relation to measures, decisions or orders taken by market surveillance authorities and other competent national authorities need to be ensured in line with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). It is necessary that Member States ensure that adequate appeal procedures against such measures, decisions or orders are in place.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure functionality, safety and sustainability of construction products, and by extension of construction works, all economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they place, make available, or support making available on the market only construction products which are in compliance with the binding Union requirements. In order to improve the legal clarity, it is necessary to set explicitly the obligations of economic operators.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary for manufacturers of construction products to determine the product type in a precise and unequivocal manner in order to ensure a precise basis for assessing the compliance of such product with Union requirements. At the same time, in order to avoid circumvention of the applicable requirements, manufacturers should be prohibited from creating ever new product types where the products in question are, in view of the crucial characteristics, identical.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nOn the internal market, the CE marking should be the only marking demonstrating compliance with assessment methods in relation to essential characteristics covered by harmonised technical specifications. In order to avoid market fragmentation and misleading claims resulting from the application of different assessment methods, the CE marking should be the only marking allowed on products covered by harmonised technical specification indicating that the product in question has been assessed in relation to the essential characteristics covered by harmonised technical specifications and is compliant with the applicable product requirements. The market for construction products faces a proliferation of markings which often create confusion and distrust among market players but also mislead consumers. The use of additional markings negatively impacts the probative value of the CE marking when based on assessment methods which are different than those defined in the relevant harmonised technical specifications. In addition, SMEs cannot always benefit from such markings, creating a distortion among market players and potentially hindering market access. Those additional markings should therefore not be affixed to the products in combination with the CE marking. However, this prohibition does not prevent products which bear other markings from being placed on the single market, providing such markings do not mislead the consumer or create confusion with the CE marking. In addition, the markings should not impair the visibility, legibility or meaning of the CE marking. As such, these markings should not display any information, text or claims in relation to the product’s performance.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nTo avoid misleading claims, any claims made by manufacturers of construction products should be based on an assessment method contained in harmonised technical specifications where available.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nTechnical documentation about construction products, drawn up by the manufacturer, facilitates the verification of those products by competent national authorities and notified bodies against the Union requirements. To enhance access to comprehensive information, that technical documentation should include the necessary information to validate the calculation substantiating the assessment of the environmental sustainability of the construction product.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nTo create transparency for users of construction products and to avoid inappropriate use of those products, construction products and their intended use should be precisely identified by the manufacturer. For the same reason, the manufacturer should make clear whether the construction products are intended for professional use. To ensure that construction products can be traced back, manufacturers should indicate manufacturer-specific unique identification code of the product type on the product or, where this is not possible e.g. due to the product’s size or surface, on an affixed label, on the packaging or, where that is not possible either, in a document accompanying the product.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure that requirements of this Regulation are fulfilled, manufacturers should actively search, store and evaluate information and take appropriate measures where non-conformity or under-performance has been confirmed or where there is a risk.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nTo achieve the goals of the European Green Deal and of the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Commission should have the possibility to specify minimum threshold levels for the environmental performance of construction products and product environmental requirements preventing and reducing the impact that construction products have on the environment. However, the ‘safety first’ principle, applicable both for the construction product and the construction works, should in all instances be respected, and should encompass the protection of health.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nWith the goals of ensuring sustainability and durability of construction products, manufacturers should ensure that products can be used for as long as possible. Such long use requires adequate design, use of reliable parts, reparability of products, availability of information on repair and access to spare parts. In the event that the spare parts are not commonly available in the market, the Commission should be empowered to require from the manufacturer to ensure the availability of these spare parts at a reasonable and non-discriminatory price for a period of 10 years which may be extended if the availability for a longer period of time is expected to increase the life span of the product.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nIn view of enhancing the circularity of construction products, in line with the goals of the Circular Economy Action Plan and the waste hierarchy, product requirements should also be able to improve resource efficiency, prevent waste generation, prioritise repair, reuse and remanufacturing, favour the use of secondary materials and address the recyclability of the product and the production of by-products. Preparing for reuse, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling require certain design, namely by facilitating the separation of products, components and materials at deinstallation, deconstruction and demolition and at the later stage of recycling and, when possible, avoiding mixed, blended or intricate materials and substances of concern. As the usual instructions for use and safety information will not necessarily reach the economic operators in charge of preparing for reuse, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling, the necessary information in this regard should be made available in digital product passports accessible through data carriers and in manufacturer’s websites.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nGeneral product information, instructions for use and safety information are a vital tool to provide information that is sufficient to make knowledgeable decisions on purchase, installation, use, maintenance, dismantling, reuse and recycling of the product to a wide group in potential need of the information. Elements to be covered by the general product information, instructions for use and safety information should therefore be specified in this Regulation and guidance on how to typically cover these elements in relation to a certain product should be possible to include in performance harmonised standards. Such guidance should however not expand or restrict the responsibility for the manufacturer to provide information as set out in the Regulation. The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to ensure adequate and homogeneous implementation of the obligation to provide the general product information, instructions for use and safety information for specific product families or product categories when performance harmonised standards are not able to do it.\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nSome construction products become waste though they were never used. To avoid this waste of resources, the Regulation should not affect the possibility for Member States to oblige manufacturers to accept to regain, directly or via their importers and distributors, ownership of products that, after delivery onto a construction site or to the user, have not been used and are in a state equivalent to the one in which they were placed on the market.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to be able to make informed choices, users of construction products should be sufficiently well informed about the environmental performances of products, about their conformity with environmental requirements and of the degree of fulfilment of manufacturer’s environmental obligations in this regard. Therefore, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to establish specific labelling requirements.\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nThe authorised representatives are often the only reachable persons in the case of imported products whilst manufacturers often attribute to them very limited tasks and do not provide them with all the necessary information to effectively represent the manufacturers. Hence, the role and responsibilities of authorised representatives should be strengthened and clearly set out in this Regulation, such as the tasks to be included in the mandate of the manufacturer. The mandate of the authorised representative should not include the drawing up of technical documentation. Nevertheless, manufacturers should be allowed to establish a separate contract with its authorised representative for this purpose, outside the scope of the mandate.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nThere should be always a manufacturer when the Regulation establishes obligations as regards the placing of a product on the market. When there is otherwise no manufacturer in the meaning of this Regulation, the distributor or importer should act as manufacturer and assume its responsibilities.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nAn economic operator who modifies a product or stores it in such a way that its performance or safety might be affected should be subject to the obligations of manufacturers, to ensure the verification whether performance or safety of the product are still the same. However, this obligation should not be imposed on an economic operator who repackages products, as otherwise secondary trade and thus free circulation of products would be hampered and repackaging in principle should not affect the performance or safety of the construction product. Still, and with the aim to preserve the performance and safety of products, the economic operator undertaking the repackaging should be responsible for the correct execution of these operations to ensure that the product is not damaged and that the users are still correctly informed in the language set out by the Member State where the products are made available.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nGiven its environmental effects, the calculation of the environmental sustainability of a construction product should also cover the packaging used or most likely to be used. The packaging of a product can also be vital to preserve its performance through the distribution chain to the user. Even though the packaging in itself is not included in other assessments of a product’s performance, all economic operators should, as part of their obligation to take necessary measures to ensure continued compliance of products with this Regulation, be responsible for using packaging suitable for preserving the performance and the compliance with the products’ requirements. The packaging could in itself pose a risk for users and the obligation to provide information on risks relating to the use of the product should take this into account.\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to increase compliance of manufacturers with the obligations under this Regulation and to contribute to addressing the identified shortcomings and improve the market surveillance, fulfilment service providers, online market places and other market actors should actively contribute to ensuring that only compliant products reach the users.\n\n(60)\n\n\t\n\nTo avoid circumvention of the obligations under this Regulation when the production technology involves several different actors who contribute to the design and manufacture of a construction product, it is necessary to establish a clearly defined manufacturer’s role where the natural or legal person who does the actual production of a construction product assumes the responsibilities under this Regulation in respect of the entire product, unless there is another person who either places the product on the market under his or her name or trademark, or assumes responsibility for the product by drawing up a declaration of performance and conformity. This is of particular importance in relation to 3D-printing, whereby a natural or legal person 3D-prints construction products and places them on the market. That person should fulfil the obligations incumbent on manufacturers including as regards the use of appropriate 3D-datasets and of materials which have undergone the procedures applicable to products as well as with regard to the correspondence of the information to be provided by the manufacturer of the 3D-dataset with the information to be provided by the manufacturer of the printing material.\n\n(61)\n\n\t\n\nIn cases when the product is not intended to be used for construction but its appearance is likely to lead consumers to use the product in construction, the product is accompanied by instructions for use and safety information pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) or another applicable regulation indicating that despite its appearance it was not designed as a construction product. Market surveillance authorities are to take the appropriate measures, including the possibility to withdraw the product from the market, if its appearance could lead to confusion for the consumer or to misuse.\n\n(62)\n\n\t\n\nTo clarify the applicability of this Regulation to online and other distance sales, it should be defined under which conditions a certain product is deemed to be offered to clients in the Union. As online trade has a higher likelihood of non-compliance, Member States should make a special effort to designate a single market surveillance authority for detecting distance sales offers targeting clients on their territory, so that the responsible market surveillance authorities can take appropriate measures. Offers using the currency of the Member States, available through an internet domain name which is registered in one of the Member States or which refers to the Union or one of the Member States, and dispatched to any Member State, should be considered targeted at customers in the Union. Other elements such as using an official language of a Member State may also be considered as an indication by market surveillance authorities as to whether the offer targets customers in the Union.\n\n(63)\n\n\t\n\nDigital technologies, which provide a significant potential for reducing administrative burden and costs for economic operators and authorities, while also fostering innovative and new business opportunities and models, are evolving at rapid pace. The uptake of digital technologies will also contribute significantly towards achieving the objectives of the Renovation Wave, including energy efficiency, life cycle assessments and monitoring and of the building stock.\n\n(64)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure a timely adoption of harmonised standards and European assessment documents, the Commission should have the possibility to make them mandatory with restrictions of their legal effects under this Regulation. It should be possible for such restrictions to cover, for example, outdated references to other standards or documents, provisions which contradict this Regulation or other Union law, provisions which contradict other harmonised standards, or provisions which are not in conformity with the demands to be met in relation to the basic principles and reference points set out in a standardisation request.\n\n(65)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure the coherence of the system, this Regulation should build on the horizontal legal framework for standardisation. Hence, Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 should also apply to the extent possible to standards made mandatory in accordance with this Regulation. Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 is thus to provide, among others, for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely conform with applicable legal requirements or satisfy the requirements set out in the relevant standardisation request or other requirements of this Regulation.\n\n(66)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should support European standardisation organisations in developing guidelines laying down a set of clear and stable rules for the whole standardisation process, including roles, responsibilities, competences and the general procedural deadlines for all stakeholders involved, as well as templates to be used. The Commission should also provide support to ensure the coherence and compliance of standards with legal requirements and should participate in the informal and formal discussions of European standardisation organisations developing the requested European standardisation deliverables, in particular on matters concerning the compliance of the standardisation deliverables with this Regulation and with other Union law. Those activities should benefit from the horizontal work developed in the context of the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n(67)\n\n\t\n\nWhen the Commission endorses by means of delegated acts proposals of European standardisation organisations related to voluntary or mandatory threshold levels and classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics and those essential characteristics which always have to be declared by manufacturers, they should be accompanied by an impact assessment where required in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (17).\n\n(68)\n\n\t\n\nAs they are not acts of general applicability but the first step of a two-step administrative procedure leading to the CE marking, European assessment documents should not qualify as harmonised technical specifications. However, basic principles of the elaboration of harmonised standards, such as transparency for competitors, can and should also apply to European assessment documents. Moreover, the European assessment documents should be referred to in the process of assessment and verification in the same way as harmonised standards. To create transparency for competitors, European assessment documents should be made publicly available and the references of all European assessment documents should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n(69)\n\n\t\n\nCurrently, the increasing number of hardly distinguishable European assessment documents which often have little added value when compared to others or existing harmonised standards, risks to slow down their publication. In order to deal with this risk in a cost-effective way, certain principles for the development and adoption of European assessment documents should be established or be made more concrete. Moreover, the control by the Commission should be enhanced.\n\n(70)\n\n\t\n\nWhere the organisation of technical assessment bodies (TABs) considers the development of a European assessment document to be useful even without any demand from a manufacturer, the organisation of TABs should bring the issue to the attention of the Commission who should decide on requesting the development of the European assessment document taking into consideration the justification provided by the organisation of TABs and the market needs.\n\n(71)\n\n\t\n\nThe requirements applicable to designating authorities of TABs should not fall behind those applicable to notifying authorities given the similarities between their respective roles. For the same reason, TABs should have the same degree of independence and control of decision-making as notified bodies.\n\n(72)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to respond to a noteworthy percentage of notifications which were based on incomplete or erroneous assessments, in particular where legal bodies without own in-house technical competence were notified, it is necessary to make requirements for notified bodies more precise, namely with regard to their independence, delegation to other legal entities and own ability to perform; to require sufficient adequate qualified staffing of notified bodies and to verify the adequacy of the staffing, for which a qualification matrix can be an efficient tool; to ensure and verify that the notified body is effectively in control of staffing, attribution of external experts, procedures, criteria and decision-making, and not a subcontractor, subsidiary or another company belonging to the same family of companies; and to enlarge the documentation to be provided by bodies when applying for designation as notified body so as to provide a deeper and comparatively fairer basis for decision to notifying authorities.\n\n(73)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the correct implementation of this Regulation, it is necessary to ensure that accreditation bodies take as a basis for accreditation this Regulation and not deviating standards. It is also important to ensure that the accreditation bodies assess the ability of the applicant body and not of a group of companies, as it is the applicant body itself that must be in control of future certification.\n\n(74)\n\n\t\n\nTo reach a level playing field and to avoid legal uncertainty, the obligations of notified bodies should be more clearly defined and rendered explicit, and this both for their assessment and verification activities and the related aspects.\n\n(75)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to avoid involvement between notified bodies’ staff and the manufacturers, it should be possible for the notified bodies to allow rotation between the personnel carrying out different conformity assessment tasks.\n\n(76)\n\n\t\n\nAuthorities of Member States might have questions that only a certain notified body can answer. Notified bodies should thus respond also to the questions authorities of other Member States may have.\n\n(77)\n\n\t\n\nTo enable authorities to more easily identify instances of non-compliance by notified bodies, manufacturers and products, and to ensure a level playing field, notified bodies should be empowered, and where the non-compliance can be clearly demonstrated even obliged to, proactively forward information on instances of non-compliance to relevant competent national authorities or notifying authorities. Notified bodies should however not trespass the information obligation by investigating other operators than their own clients or peers.\n\n(78)\n\n\t\n\nWith a view to creating a level playing field for notified bodies and manufacturers, the coordination amongst notified bodies should be enhanced. As only half of the current notified bodies participate on their own initiative in the activities of the already currently existing notified body coordination group, direct participation or by means of designated representatives thereto should thus become mandatory.\n\n(79)\n\n\t\n\nThe attempts of establishing simplified procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises in Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 and thus reducing the burden and costs on SMEs and microenterprises have not been entirely effective and have often remained misunderstood or not used due to the lack of awareness or the lack of clarity regarding their application. By addressing the identified shortcomings while building on the previously established rules, it is necessary to clarify and facilitate their application and hence achieve the objective of supporting SMEs while ensuring performance, safety and environmental sustainability of construction products.\n\n(80)\n\n\t\n\nThe recognition of test results obtained by another manufacturer, provided for in Article 36(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, should be generalised, in order to generally reduce the burden of economic operators and namely manufacturers. Such recognition mechanism is particularly needed to avoid multiple assessment of environmental sustainability of raw materials, interim products and final products.\n\n(81)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure legal certainty in the event of safety or performance problems, such recognition should only be permitted where the assessed and verified economic operators agree to cooperate between themselves and with the notified bodies involved, including the necessary sharing of data.\n\n(82)\n\n\t\n\nThe evaluation of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 showed that market surveillance activities carried out at national level, widely vary in quality and effectiveness. In addition to measures set out in this Regulation and under relevant Union law in favour of better market surveillance, the compliance of economic operators, bodies and products with this Regulation should be facilitated by also involving third parties such as by the possibility of any natural or legal person to submit information on instances of non-compliance through a complaint portal established and maintained by the Commission. The handling of complaints adheres to the right to good administration, as outlined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In handling the complaints the Commission should take into account the relevance and substantiation of the complaint by prioritising those complaints raising issues having particularly far-reaching negative impacts for citizens or the internal market. For a complaint to be considered substantiated the Commission should particularly check if the complaint manages to set out a grievance or if the grievance sets out an issue where the Commission has adopted a clear, public and consistent position which has been communicated to the complainant. The Commission should reply to the complainant without undue delay and efficiently transmit the complaints to the relevant Member States who should handle these complaints promptly and effectively in accordance with their legal frameworks and obligations.\n\n(83)\n\n\t\n\nTo address the identified shortcomings with regards to the market surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, this Regulation should contain more justified empowerments for market surveillance authorities and for the Commission that should enable authorities to act under all potential problematic circumstances.\n\n(84)\n\n\t\n\nMarket surveillance practice has proved that when evaluating products, at a certain point in time, there is a risk of non-compliance but no non-compliance incidence whereas, at a later point in time, the opposite is to be stated. Moreover, there are situations where there is a non-compliance other than a formal one that does not trigger a risk. For these reasons, Member States should be empowered to act in all cases of suspected non-compliance or risk, whilst the definition of ‘product presenting a risk’ has to be extended to include risk for the environment. It is necessary to offer Member States enough procedural flexibility to distinguish between high and low priority cases of non-compliance, whilst all Member States should also be informed about less important cases.\n\n(85)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure effective enforcement of the requirements and to strengthen market surveillance in Member States the Commission should issue guidelines for the application of this Regulation, as well as common practices and methodologies for effective market surveillance, including, for example, elements such as a recommended number and type of checks to be performed by the market surveillance authorities on specific product category or family or in relation to specific requirements. It is appropriate that such recommendations be based on good practices developed in the framework of market surveillance.\n\n(86)\n\n\t\n\nIn addition, to strengthen the on average weak capacities of market surveillance authorities in terms of market surveillance and to further align with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, it is necessary to provide more detailed administrative coordination support and to provide them with the right to retrieve costs of inspections and testing from economic operators in relation to non-compliant products.\n\n(87)\n\n\t\n\nTo create an incentive for increasing the capacities of market surveillance authorities in terms of market surveillance and to reach alignment with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, Member States should report on their market surveillance activities regarding products covered by this Regulation, including regarding the penalties imposed.\n\n(88)\n\n\t\n\nTo better serve economic operators, product contact points for construction should become more effective and therefore should obtain more resources. In order to facilitate the work of economic operators, the tasks of product contact points for construction should be fine-tuned and extended so as to include information on product related provisions of this Regulation and on acts adopted in accordance with it. Member States should also raise economic operators’ awareness of the product contact points for construction within their territory.\n\n(89)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to establish an appropriate, efficient and cost-effective coordination mechanism to ensure a consistent application of the obligations and requirements set and to strengthen the overall system, also taking into consideration the fact that new interpretative questions may arise in relation to safety and sustainability of products and construction works. As diverging decisions create an uneven playing field, contribute to rendering the legal framework more complex, create barriers to the free movement of the internal market and additional administrative burden and costs on economic operators, such diverging decisions should be prevented by that coordination mechanism.\n\n(90)\n\n\t\n\nIn particular, an information and communication system should therefore be established to collect questions related to interpretation, to find appropriate common solutions and to improve the sharing of information in this regard. To facilitate information sharing, such a system should rely on national systems. Those national systems should also identify cases of uneven application of this Regulation, to ensure that diverging practices do not become a common practice and permanent. The information and communication system should also deal with issues raised related to the emergence of new products or business models, unforeseen situations and to situations in which other provisions of Union law also apply.\n\n(91)\n\n\t\n\nDigitalisation and availability of product information increases transparency to the benefit of safety of products and the protection of the environment and health of persons while also reducing administrative burden and costs for economic operators. Accordingly, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to establish a construction digital product passport system aligned to the extent possible to the digital product passport under Regulation (EU) 2024/1781.\n\n(92)\n\n\t\n\nTo improve machine readability, it is necessary to establish a common data dictionary based on European standards, a tool to govern and publish the data structure and their meaningful definitions and descriptions for all relevant construction products. For each product family or product category, the data dictionary should include all the essential characteristics and other properties as set out in the harmonised technical specifications as well as other information required by this Regulation. A data dictionary harmonised at the Union level allows for the classification and use of structured definitions by both competent national authorities and in the further digitalisation of the construction sector, in particular in Building Information Modelling, building logbooks, digital passports and registries.\n\n(93)\n\n\t\n\nTo improve their level of competence, harmonise their decision-making and create a level playing field for economic operators, trainings should be organised for market surveillance authorities, product contact points for construction, designating authorities, notifying authorities, and representatives of notified bodies and TABs. The same goals should also be pursued by exchanges of staff between the market surveillance authorities, notifying authorities and notified bodies of two or more Member States.\n\n(94)\n\n\t\n\nMember States do not always have the technical competence to fulfil all obligations incumbent on them in accordance with Union legislation cumulatively for all product sectors. They therefore obtain informal support, from other Member States. Since such support is unavoidable in some cases, this Regulation should set out the basic rules for such support, namely to clarify responsibilities.\n\n(95)\n\n\t\n\nBusiness on construction products becomes slowly but steadily more and more international. Hence, situations arise where non-compliance by economic operators based outside the Union need to be countered as well. Provisions on international cooperation should therefore be provided for in this Regulation.\n\n(96)\n\n\t\n\nA certain number of third countries applies Union product legislation or at least recognises certificates issued in accordance with it, be it on the basis of international agreements or unilaterally, both being in the interest of the Union. In order to give these third countries an incentive to continue this practice and other third countries to do the same, certain additional possibilities should be provided, on a case-by-case basis, to third countries applying Union product legislation or recognising certificates issued in accordance with it. For this reason, it should be possible, after consultation with Member States, to support these particularly cooperative third countries by allowing them to participate in certain trainings and to participate in the construction digital product passport system, to the information system for harmonised decision-making and to the information exchange amongst authorities. Moreover, for the same reason, it should be possible to inform these particularly cooperative third countries about non-compliant or risky products.\n\n(97)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to incentivise the use of sustainable construction products whilst avoiding market distortions and to remain in line with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, incentives for the use of sustainable construction products provided by Member States should target the most sustainable products. The Commission should furthermore have the possibility to coordinate Member States incentives in order to boost the demand of certain environmentally sustainable products. Member States might also provide incentives to promote environmentally friendly and sustainable construction products that are not covered by harmonised technical specifications in line with State aid rules.\n\n(98)\n\n\t\n\nPublic procurement amounts to 14 % of Union’s GDP. In order to enhance the use of sustainable construction products, which would contribute to the objective of reaching climate neutrality, improve energy and resource efficiency and in the transition to a circular economy that protects public health and biodiversity and to reach alignment with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, the public procurement practices of the Member States should comply with mandatory minimum performance requirements on environmental sustainability for construction products set out by delegated acts. The Commission should decide the essential characteristics to be addressed and its implementation in the form of one or more of the following: technical specifications, selection criteria, contract performance clauses or contract award criteria. The mandatory minimum performance requirements on environmental sustainability deal with essential characteristics only and do not pre-empt the possibility for Member States to be more ambitious in their contracts by requesting better performances for the relevant essential characteristics while respecting the harmonised zone.\n\n(99)\n\n\t\n\nContracting authorities and contracting entities should, where appropriate, be required to align their procurement with specific green public procurement criteria, to be set out in the delegated acts referred to in this Regulation. The criteria for specific product families or product categories should be complied with where contracts require mandatory minimum environmental sustainability performance for construction products as regards their essential characteristics covered by harmonised technical specifications. Those minimum requirements should be established in accordance with transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When developing delegated acts related to green public procurement, the Commission should take due account of the Member States different geographical, social and economic circumstances. When considering the effect on the market situation, the Commission should take into account, among others, the effects of the requirements on competition, SMEs and the best environmental products and solutions available on the market. When considering the economic feasibility for contracting authorities and contracting entities, the Commission should take into account that different contracting authorities in different Member States might have different budgetary capacities. In duly justified cases, contracting authorities should be able to derogate from the requirements such as when there is only one supplier, there are no suitable tenders or its application would lead to a disproportionate cost.\n\n(100)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market in the event of an internal market emergency as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2024/2748 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), for the reasons set out in that Regulation, it is necessary to provide for rules on construction products designated as crisis-relevant goods, prioritisation of the assessment and verification of those products, assessment and declaration of performance based on standards and common specifications as well as on prioritisation of market surveillance activities and mutual assistance among authorities, in the case of an active internal market emergency mode under that Regulation.\n\n(101)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to take into account technical progress and knowledge of new scientific evidence, ensure proper functioning of the internal market, facilitate access to information and ensure homogeneous implementation of rules, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annexes II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX and X and amending this Regulation to further specify, add and remove certain functionalities and revise certain provisions with a view to ensuring compatibility and interoperability with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781. For the same reasons the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by: determining voluntary or mandatory threshold levels in relation to the essential characteristics, classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics, and the essential characteristics which always have to be declared by manufacturers; determining elements of standardisation requests and conditions under which a product is to be deemed to satisfy a certain level or threshold level or to qualify for a class of performance without testing or without further testing; establishing product requirements in accordance with Annex III; establishing rules on the provision of general product information, instructions for use and safety information for the respective product family or product category; determining, for each product family or product category, the applicable assessment and verification system among those set out in Annex IX; laying down conditions under which obligations relating to the assessment of a product’s performance or the fulfilment of certain product requirements can be satisfied by the fulfilment of obligations under other Union legal acts; imposing in respect of certain product families and product categories an obligation on manufacturers to make available on the market specific spare parts not commonly available for the products they place on the market; establishing specific environmental sustainability labelling requirements for particular product families and product categories; setting up a construction digital product passport system; and by specifying mandatory minimum environmental sustainability requirements for construction products. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. When developing those acts, the Commission should aim at reducing the administrative burden for companies and take into account the needs of SMEs.\n\n(102)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19).\n\n(103)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to health and safety of persons or the protection of the environment, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n\n(104)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 lays down rules on a horizontal framework for market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market. In order to ensure that products under this Regulation, which are benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Union, fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests, such as the protection of health and safety of persons and the protection of the environment, that Regulation should apply also to products covered by this Regulation, in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, nature or effect in this Regulation.\n\n(105)\n\n\t\n\nTo render the implementation of this Regulation more efficient and to reduce the burden for economic operators, it should be possible to make applications and decisions on paper or in a commonly used electronic format. To obtain legal certainty, applications and decisions should only be valid where the electronic signature fulfils the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) and where the signing person is entrusted to represent the body or economic operator, in accordance with the law of the Member States or Union law respectively.\n\n(106)\n\n\t\n\nTo further reduce the burden on economic operators, it should be possible to provide documentation in a commonly used electronic format, and to fulfil information requirements electronically by default.\n\n(107)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure a high level of compliance with this Regulation, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to instances of non-compliance and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n(108)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to create legal certainty, it should be specified whether and for how long designations of product contact points for construction, TABs, or notified bodies and harmonised standards, European assessment documents, European technical assessments and notified bodies certificates or test reports adopted or issued under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 maintain legal effects under this Regulation. The respective transitional periods should be long enough to avoid bottlenecks in respect of notified bodies and TABs designation and of the adoption or issuing of European assessment documents, European technical assessments, and notified body certificates or test reports.\n\n(109)\n\n\t\n\nTo create legal certainty, it should be clarified for how long products placed on the market on the basis of European technical assessments issued in accordance with European assessment documents adopted under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 may be placed on the market.\n\n(110)\n\n\t\n\nBoth the essential characteristics of construction products and their assessment methods can only be determined by harmonised technical specifications to be developed for the various product families and product categories, or by European assessment documents. Accordingly, requirements and obligations incumbent on economic operators with regard to a certain product family or product category should only apply mandatorily as of 12 months after the entry into force of harmonised technical specification covering the respective product family or product category unless a later application date has been specified in the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n(111)\n\n\t\n\nTo facilitate a smooth phasing-in of future harmonised technical specifications and taking into consideration the time needed for drawing up the declaration of performance and conformity, economic operators should be permitted to opt for the voluntary application of this Regulation as from the entry into force of these harmonised technical specifications.\n\n(112)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to avoid that economic operators can permanently circumvent the application of this Regulation by applying the harmonised technical specifications adopted under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011. For this reason, the Commission should withdraw from the Official Journal of the European Union the references to harmonised standards and European assessment documents published in support of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 and covering a certain product family or product category by the entry into application of harmonised technical specification adopted under this Regulation covering that respective product family or product category.\n\n(113)\n\n\t\n\nWhile the concept of basic requirements for construction works is kept as the technically necessary link between construction works and construction products, it should be made explicit that they do not constitute obligations incumbent upon economic operators or Member States seeing as the right to regulate construction works is a competence of Member States. In order to cover the environmental assessment of construction products as well as product requirements which exist even in current harmonised technical specifications, a more comprehensive Annex I should be developed, including also a detailed list of predetermined environmental essential characteristics related to life cycle assessment and a framework for the product requirements. On that occasion, overlaps between basic requirements for construction works should be eliminated and clarifications should be brought forward.\n\n(114)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to reach a minimum control intensity of the assessment and verification of manufacturers by notified bodies and to create a level playing field both for manufacturers and notified bodies, Annex IX on assessment and verification systems should more precisely and comprehensively determine the tasks of manufacturers and notified bodies under different possible assessment and verification systems. Moreover, that Annex should determine the assessments and verifications to be undertaken to verify the environmental sustainability of products, in terms of product performance and product requirements. When the Commission defines the applicable assessment and verification system for a product family or product category, continuity with Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 and coherence across product families should be the guiding principles.\n\n(115)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure the free movement of safe and sustainable construction products in the internal market, to contribute to the green and digital transition and to protect health and safety of persons and the environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, as Member States tend to establish very diverging requirements for construction products, with an uneven level of protection of health and safety of persons and of the environment, but can rather be better achieved at Union level by establishing a harmonised assessment framework for the performance of construction products and certain product requirements for the protection of health and safety of persons and of the environment, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter and objectives\n\n1.   This Regulation lays down harmonised rules for the placing and making available on the market of construction products, regardless of whether undertaken in the framework of a service or not, by establishing:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nharmonised rules on how to express the environmental and safety performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics, including on life cycle assessment;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nenvironmental, functional and safety product requirements for construction products.\n\n2.   This Regulation also establishes:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nrights and obligations for economic operators dealing with construction products or their components; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nobligations for other actors providing services linked to the manufacturing and commercialisation of products covered by this Regulation.\n\n3.   This Regulation aims to contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of safe and sustainable construction products in the Union. It also aims to contribute to the objectives of a green and digital transition by preventing and reducing the impact that construction products have on the environment and on the health and safety of persons.\n\nArticle 2\n\nScope\n\n1.   This Regulation applies to construction products, including used products, and to the following items:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nkey parts of products; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nparts or materials intended to be used for products covered by this Regulation, if the manufacturer of those parts or materials so requests.\n\n2.   This Regulation does not apply to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nlifts subject to Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), escalators or their components;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nrequirements or performance assessment subject to Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) and covered by the delegated acts of the Commission referred to in Article 11(8) of that Directive.\n\n3.   Member States may exempt from the application of this Regulation products falling within its scope that are placed on the market in the outermost regions of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 TFEU. Member States shall notify to the Commission and to the other Member States the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions providing such exemptions. They shall ensure that exempted products do not bear the CE marking referred to in Article 17. Products placed on the market on the basis of that exemption shall not be deemed to have been placed on the market in the Union within the meaning of this Regulation.\n\nArticle 3\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\n‘construction product’ means any formed or formless physical

The CPR Acquis Expert Group shall be composed at least of experts designated by the Member States, representatives of European standardisation organisations and of relevant European stakeholder organisations receiving Union financing under Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. The CPR Acquis Expert Group shall support the Commission in processing Member States’ requests for Union harmonisation through harmonised technical specifications. In particular, the CPR Acquis Expert Group shall assist the Commission in establishing and updating a working plan for the development of harmonised technical specifications, in preparing the technical content related to harmonised technical specifications, in deciding on the need to launch the procedures in relation to harmonised technical specifications that present deficiencies, are unavailable, or not able to cover immediate regulatory needs, and in determining the inclusion of used products in harmonised technical specifications.\n\n2.   After consulting the CPR Acquis Expert Group, the Commission shall establish a working plan for the development of harmonised technical specifications for product families listed in Annex VII, including product requirements as well as general product information, instructions for use and safety information, covering at least the following three-year period. The Commission shall set the priorities of the working plan using a transparent and balanced methodology, which shall be published together with the working plan. That methodology shall at least reflect the regulatory needs of the Member States, the safety issues related to construction works and products and the climate and circular economy goals of the Union.\n\nThe Commission shall publish the first working plan no later than 8 January 2026.\n\nThe Commission shall renew and update the working plan at least every three years. It shall publish the working plan for the following three-year period one year before the expiration of the working plan in force.\n\nThe Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Member States annually about progress in implementing the working plan.\n\nIf the Commission considers that it cannot achieve the goals set out in the working plan, it shall amend it accordingly without undue delay, and shall inform the European Parliament and the Member States about the reasons thereof.\n\n3.   Following the working plan established under paragraph 2, Member States shall communicate to the Commission and the CPR Acquis Expert Group the essential characteristics they require for a product family or product category, and the assessment methods, threshold levels or classes of performance, as well as the product requirements, that they deem necessary.\n\nWhen Member States communicate their regulatory needs to the Commission pursuant to the first subparagraph, the Commission shall integrate them or shall provide a statement of reasons why it is not possible to do so.\n\n4.   On the basis of the basic requirements for construction works set out in Annex I and taking into account the regulatory needs communicated by Member States in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, as well as the safety, environmental, circularity and climate objectives of the Union, the Commission, with the support of the CPR Acquis Expert Group, shall identify the technical aspects needed to prepare standardisation requests, including the relevant essential characteristics. Those essential characteristics and the list of predetermined environmental essential characteristics set out in Annex II shall constitute the basis for the preparation of the standardisation requests referred to in Article 5(2) and of the implementing acts referred to in Article 6(1).\n\n5.   The Commission shall ensure that essential characteristics are covered by harmonised technical specifications to the extent that the development of such specifications is technically and economically proportionate.\n\n6.   The Commission, with the support of the CPR Acquis Expert Group, shall identify the product requirements referred to in Article 7, as well as other harmonised technical specifications, and shall determine whether used products are to be covered by or excluded from a standardisation request or a harmonised technical specification. The CPR Acquis Expert Group shall, as a matter of urgency, be consulted on notifications from Member States made in accordance with Article 11(5).\n\n7.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to amend:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe list of predetermined environmental essential characteristics set out in Annex II in order to adapt it to technical progress and new environmental risks and to comply with the priorities established pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article based on the regulatory needs of the Member States;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe product families listed in Annex VII, to adapt them to technical progress and to the regulatory needs of the Member States.\n\nArticle 5\n\nHarmonised standards laying down essential characteristics dealing with performance\n\n1.   The methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of a product in relation to its essential characteristics shall be laid down in harmonised standards made mandatory by means of the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 8 (‘performance harmonised standards’). Performance harmonised standards shall, where appropriate and without endangering the accuracy, reliability or stability of the results, provide methods for assessing the performance of the products in relation to their essential characteristics that are less onerous than testing.\n\n2.   The Commission shall, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, request one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards laying down essential characteristics and their assessment methods for one or more product families, or for one or more product categories within a family. The standardisation request shall set out the basic principles and reference points for the establishment of those essential characteristics and their assessment methods. The standardisation request shall explicitly state whether it covers or excludes used products from the scope of the request.\n\n3.   As part of the standardisation requests referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission may also request the European standardisation organisations to provide the technical details necessary for the implementation of the assessment and verification system that is to be applied in accordance with the delegated acts referred to in Article 10(2).\n\n4.   The standardisation requests referred to in paragraph 2 may include a request to propose one or more of the following elements:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nvoluntary or mandatory threshold levels in relation to the essential characteristics;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nclasses of performance in relation to the essential characteristics;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthose essential characteristics which always have to be declared by manufacturers.\n\nSuch standardisation requests shall set out the basic principles and reference points for the establishment of the elements requested.\n\n5.   Where it has included with its standardisation request a request for a proposal in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation by determining, for the product families or product categories and for the elements covered by that request, the elements referred to in paragraph 4, first subparagraph of this Article.\n\nAfter consulting the CPR Acquis Expert Group, the Commission may deviate from the proposals of the European standardisation organisation.\n\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, irrespective of any prior standardisation request but on the advice of the CPR Acquis Expert Group, in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation by determining the elements set out in paragraph 4, first subparagraph of this Article in relation to any of the groupings of essential characteristics of a horizontal nature listed in Annex X.\n\n6.   In cases where, on the basis of the nature or technical characteristics of a product, it is apparent that testing would be unnecessary or redundant, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation by laying down conditions under which a product is to be deemed to satisfy a certain level, threshold level or to qualify for a class of performance without testing, or without further testing.\n\n7.   The Commission shall assess the compliance of harmonised standards with the relevant standardisation requests, with this Regulation and with other Union law, including general principles of law. The Commission may assess whether harmonised standards comply with other harmonised standards under this Regulation or with other harmonised standards the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThe Commission shall carry out the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and present its reasons in writing to the relevant European standardisation organisation and to the CPR Acquis Expert Group within six months after the relevant harmonised standard has been transmitted to it. Where the Commission considers that a standard, or a part thereof, is unsatisfactory, it shall specify the deficiencies. In order for the Commission to fulfil that obligation within that timeframe, the European standardisation organisations shall regularly inform the Commission of the progress and content of the European standardisation deliverable in accordance with Article 10(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n8.   Where a harmonised standard is in conformity with applicable legal requirements and satisfies the requirements to be met in relation to the basic principles and reference points set out in the standardisation request, as well as in relation to the essential characteristics to be covered in view of the basic requirements for construction works, the Commission shall without delay adopt an implementing act making that standard mandatory. One year after such adoption the performance harmonised standard shall become mandatory for the purposes of this Regulation unless a later application date has been specified in the implementing act. A later application date shall be specified only in exceptional cases and its use shall be duly justified. A performance harmonised standard may be voluntarily applied from the date of the adoption of the implementing act.\n\nWhere the Commission considers a harmonised standard or a part thereof to be unsatisfactory, it may adopt an implementing act making that harmonised standard mandatory with restrictions.\n\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first and second subparagraph shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 90(2).\n\nWhere it is not possible to make a harmonised standard mandatory with restrictions, the Commission may adopt an implementing act in accordance with Article 6.\n\n9.   When a Member State, the European Parliament or the Commission, the last with the support of the CPR Acquis Expert Group, considers that a performance harmonised standard does not entirely fulfil the applicable legal requirements or satisfy the demands to be met in relation to the essential characteristics to be covered in view of the basic requirements for construction works, the procedure for formal objections to harmonised standards as set out in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 shall apply.\n\n10.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to amend Annex X by adding additional groupings of essential characteristics of a horizontal nature.\n\nArticle 6\n\nOther harmonised technical specifications laying down essential characteristics\n\n1.   While priority shall be given to the elaboration of standards, by way of derogation from Article 5(1) to (4) of this Regulation, in order to cover the regulatory needs of Member States and to pursue the goals of Article 114 TFEU, the Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down essential characteristics, their assessment methods and technical details pursuant to Article 5 of this Regulation for one or more product families or for one or more product categories within a family.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted only if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe Commission has requested, pursuant to Article 5(2), one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a harmonised standard and:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nthe request has not been accepted; or\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nthe harmonised standard addressing that request is not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 and no later than three years after the acceptance of the standardisation request; or\n\n(iii)\n\n\t\n\nthe harmonised standard does not comply with the request; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nno implementing act, as referred to in Article 5(8), first subparagraph, making mandatory a harmonised standard covering the essential characteristics, their assessment methods and technical details pursuant to Article 5 was adopted in the last 5 years, or such an implementing act was adopted within the last five years, but with restrictions, as referred to in Article 5(8), second subparagraph.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).\n\n2.   Before preparing a draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers that the conditions in paragraph 1 of this Article are fulfilled.\n\n3.   When preparing the draft implementing act, the Commission shall take into account the views of relevant bodies and of the CPR Acquis Expert Group and shall duly consult all relevant stakeholder organisations receiving Union financing under Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n4.   Where an implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article covers the same essential characteristics or assessment methods in relation to a specific product family or product category as a harmonised standard the reference of which has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union or in respect of which an implementing act referred to in Article 5(8) has been adopted, the Commission shall withdraw from the Official Journal of the European Union the reference of that harmonised standard or repeal that implementing act. Where the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article only partially covers the harmonised standard, the Commission shall retain the implementing act laying down a harmonised standard that is subject to restrictions.\n\n5.   When a Member State or the European Parliament considers that an implementing act adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 does not entirely satisfy the requirements to be met in relation to the essential characteristics to be covered in view of the basic requirements for construction works, it shall inform the Commission thereof, by submitting a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that detailed explanation and may, if appropriate, amend the implementing act in question.\n\n6.   The Commission shall follow the procedure in Article 5 to request any revision or update of the essential characteristics or assessment methods in relation to the same product families or product categories as those covered by the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Where the harmonised standard delivered by the European standardisation organisation is suitable to be adopted in accordance with Article 5(8), the Commission shall repeal the implementing act adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, or the parts thereof which cover the same essential characteristics or assessment methods in relation to the same product families or product categories as those covered by the harmonised standard.\n\nArticle 7\n\nProduct requirements and harmonised standards conferring a presumption of conformity\n\n1.   Where a product family, or one or more product categories within a product family, is covered either by a performance harmonised standard or by an implementing act referred to in Article 6(1), the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation, by establishing product requirements in accordance with Annex III for that product family or product category, or for parts thereof.\n\n2.   Prior to their placing on the market, products covered by this Regulation shall satisfy the applicable product requirements.\n\n3.   The Commission may, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, request one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards conferring the presumption of conformity (‘voluntary harmonised standards’) for the product requirements established by delegated acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n4.   Where a voluntary harmonised standard requested in accordance with paragraph 3 is adopted by a European standardisation organisation and proposed to the Commission for the purpose of publishing its reference in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall assess the voluntary harmonised standard in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n5.   Where a voluntary harmonised standard is in conformity with the applicable legal requirements and satisfies the requirements in relation to the product requirements set out in the standardisation request, the Commission shall without delay publish the reference of that standard in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\n6.   Where the reference of a voluntary harmonised standard cannot be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission may publish such a reference with restrictions. Where a reference of a voluntary harmonised standard cannot be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and cannot be published as a reference with restrictions, the Commission shall bring the issue to the attention of the committee referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 and of the CPR Acquis Expert Group.\n\n7.   A product subject to product requirements which is in conformity with voluntary harmonised standards or parts thereof, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the product requirements covered by those standards or parts thereof.\n\n8.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to amend Annex III in order to adapt it to technical progress and to cover new risks and environmental aspects and to comply with the priorities established in Article 4, based on the regulatory needs of the Member States.\n\nArticle 8\n\nCommon specifications conferring a presumption of conformity\n\n1.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing common specifications that provide an alternative means to comply with the product requirements established in accordance with Article 7(1).\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted only where the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe Commission has requested, pursuant to Article 7(3), one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a voluntary harmonised standard for the product requirements and:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nthe request has not been accepted; or\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nthe voluntary harmonised standard addressing that request is not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; or\n\n(iii)\n\n\t\n\nthe voluntary harmonised standard does not comply with the request; and\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nno reference of voluntary harmonised standards covering the product requirements has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 and no such reference is expected to be published within a reasonable period.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).\n\n2.   Before preparing a draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers that the conditions in paragraph 1 of this Article have been fulfilled.\n\n3.   When preparing the draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall take into account the views of the relevant bodies and of the CPR Acquis Expert Group and shall duly consult all relevant stakeholder organisations receiving Union financing under Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n4.   A product which is in conformity with the common specifications established by implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, or parts thereof, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the product requirements established by delegated acts referred to in Article 7(1) covered by those common specifications or parts thereof.\n\n5.   The Commission shall repeal the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, or parts thereof which cover the same product requirements as those covered by a voluntary harmonised standard the reference of which is published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 7(5) or (6).\n\n6.   When a Member State or the European Parliament considers that a common specification does not entirely satisfy the product requirements established by delegated acts referred to in Article 7(1), it shall inform the Commission thereof, by submitting a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that detailed explanation and may, if appropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification in question.\n\nArticle 9\n\nGeneral product information, instructions for use and safety information\n\n1.   General product information, instructions for use and safety information shall be provided in relation to construction products covered by a harmonised technical specification or a European technical assessment. The content of the general product information, instructions for use and safety information is set out in Annex IV.\n\n2.   As part of the standardisation request referred to in Article 5(2), the Commission may also request the European standardisation organisation to issue guidelines, including technical details, necessary for drawing up general product information, instructions for use and safety information in accordance with Annex IV.\n\n3.   If the Commission considers that the guidelines issued by the European standardisation organisation pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article for a specific product family or product category do not ensure adequate and homogeneous implementation of paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation by establishing rules on the provision of general product information, instructions for use and safety information for the respective product family or product category.\n\n4.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to amend Annex IV in order to adapt it to technical progress and new information needs.\n\nArticle 10\n\nAssessment and verification systems\n\n1.   The assessment and verification of a product’s performance in relation to its essential characteristics, as set out in harmonised technical specifications adopted in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 or in European assessment documents referred to in Article 31, or of the product’s conformity with product requirements adopted in accordance with Article 7, shall be carried out in accordance with one or more of the systems set out in Annex IX.\n\n2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation, by determining, for each product family or product category, the applicable assessment and verification system among those referred to in Annex IX. Those delegated acts may determine different assessment and verification systems within the same product family or product category, differentiating by essential characteristic or product requirement. The assessment and verification systems shall be determined before the harmonised technical specifications or European assessment documents become applicable.\n\n3.   The delegated acts adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 shall take into account the intended uses, the potential damage resulting from product deficiencies, the product’s sensitivity to performance variations under production conditions, the likelihood of errors during its manufacturing and the possibility of easily detecting manufacturing errors. Those delegated acts shall be tailored to the respective product families or product categories and shall minimise the burden on manufacturers, whilst ensuring a high level of protection of health and safety of persons and of the environment.\n\n4.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 in order to amend Annex IX to:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nintroduce additional assessment and verification systems when necessary to adapt to technical progress; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\namend the existing assessment and verification systems to counter systematic non-compliance by notified bodies or manufacturers and to harmonise the application of the requirements or obligations contained in them, without such amendments adding or removing any task defined in a system.\n\nWhen adopting delegated acts under point (a), the Commission may not introduce additional systems that set more demanding obligations for economic operators than those provided for in System 1+. In addition, the Commission may introduce such additional systems only when it is evident that guidance on the application of existing systems has proved to be insufficient.\n\nArticle 11\n\nHarmonised zone and national measures\n\n1.   This Regulation, and the harmonised technical specifications adopted in accordance with it, together, establish a ‘harmonised zone’.\n\nThe harmonised zone covers all products subject to harmonised technical specifications.\n\nHarmonised technical specifications shall be presumed to be comprehensive, in the following respects:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nlaying down all essential characteristics and their assessment methods;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nspecifying all product requirements other than those covered by other Union law; and\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\ndetermining the applicable assessment and verification systems.\n\nHarmonised technical specifications for new products shall apply to used products from third countries unless the harmonised technical specification explicitly provides rules for used products.\n\n2.   Member States shall respect the harmonised zone in their national laws, regulations and administrative measures, and shall neither prohibit nor impede the making available on the market of products covered by it when those products are in compliance with this Regulation. Member States shall not lay down essential characteristics and their assessment methods or product requirements other than those set out in the harmonised technical specifications.\n\nThe harmonised zone does not affect the right of Member States to specify national requirements for the use of products that are subject to harmonised technical specifications. Any assessment methods and systems for assessment and verification set out in such national requirements shall be in accordance with the applicable harmonised technical specifications.\n\nMember States shall ensure that the making available on the market of products within the harmonised zone which are in compliance with this Regulation shall not be impeded by rules or conditions imposed by public bodies or by private bodies acting as a public undertaking or private bodies acting as a public body on the basis of a monopoly position or under a public mandate.\n\n3.   When complying with the obligations provided for in paragraph 2, Member States shall in particular apply the following rules:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nno requirements for information or registration related to the placing on the market of the product other than those laid down in the harmonised zone shall be established;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nno assessments of the product other than those set out in the harmonised zone shall be made mandatory;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nno markings attesting to conformity with requirements or declared performances in relation to essential characteristics covered by the harmonised zone shall be required other than the CE marking, and any existing provisions in national measures requiring such markings shall be withdrawn;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nnational laws, regulations and administrative measures shall respect the threshold levels established in accordance with Article 5(5);\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nnational laws, regulations and administrative measures shall not be based on classes, sub-classes or additional classes other than those established in accordance with Article 5;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nnational laws, regulations and administrative measures shall not require more assessments and verifications than those established in accordance with Article 10(1).\n\n4.   Member States shall register in the Single Digital Gateway established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) all their national laws, regulations and administrative measures related to construction products on their territory covered by the harmonised zone.\n\n5.   Where a Member State deems it necessary on imperative grounds of health and safety of persons or protection of the environment and in order to address immediate regulatory needs, to take measures applicable to products within the harmonised zone in relation to characteristics not laid down in harmonised technical specifications, it shall notify the Commission thereof, justifying the need for the measures taken and explaining the regulatory need it aims to address.\n\nTo that end, Member States shall use the procedure set up by Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26). When doing so, Member States shall make reference to this paragraph and specify which elements are part of the measure.\n\nThe Commission shall reply to the notification within the time limits established in the procedure set up by Directive (EU) 2015/1535. The Commission shall within six months of the notification either put forward a proposal for authorisation in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article or communicate its grounds for rejecting the national measure.\n\nUpon receipt of a notification as referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall, irrespective of whether it intends to authorise the measure, without delay submit the matter to the CPR Acquis Expert Group for consultations on whether updates to existing performance harmonised standards need to be requested as a priority.\n\n6.   The Commission shall adopt an implementing act, authorising the national measure notified under paragraph 5 where:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe notified measure appears duly justified in the light of imperative grounds of health and safety of persons or protection of the environment, including the climate;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe regulatory need is not covered by harmonised technical specifications or by other Union law;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe notified measure does not discriminate against economic operators of other Member States;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe notified measure is able to cover the respective regulatory need;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe notified measure does not constitute a serious obstacle to the functioning of the internal market; and\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthe notified measure is not expected to be covered by a harmonised standard which is to be delivered within one year from the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, following a standardisation request issued pursuant to Article 5(2), or, at the moment of that notification, no implementing act referred to in Article 6(1) has been presented to the committee referred to in Article 90(1).\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3). They shall be withdrawn once the regulatory need is covered by harmonised technical specifications or by other Union law.\n\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to health and safety of persons or the protection of the environment, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 90(4).\n\n7.   This Regulation does not affect the possibility for Member States to introduce mandatory deposit-refund systems or to oblige manufacturers to accept to regain, directly or via their importers and distributors, ownership of their new, surplus or unsold non-custom-made products that are in a state equivalent to that in which they were placed on the market, provided that the measure does not directly or indirectly discriminate against economic operators in other Member States.\n\n8.   This Regulation does not affect the possibility for Member States to ban the destruction of surplus or unsold products, or to make their destruction conditional upon their previously having been made available on a national brokering platform for non-commercial use of products.\n\nArticle 12\n\nRelationship with other Union law\n\n1.   To avoid double assessment of the same aspects of health and safety of persons or protection of the environment in respect of products, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation by laying down the conditions under which obligations relating to the assessment of a product’s performance or the fulfilment of certain product requirements, including the equivalence of assessment and verification systems required under this Regulation and obligations as regards general product information, instructions for use and safety information requirements, can be satisfied by the fulfilment of obligations provided for under other Union law.\n\nThe conditions referred to in the first subparagraph shall not allow for product safety levels which are less strict than those established in accordance with this Regulation.\n\n2.   Where conflicts arise between this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 as well as Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, the relevant provisions of this Regulation shall prevail.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nPROCEDURE, DECLARATIONS AND MARKINGS\n\nArticle 13\n\nDeclaration of performance and conformity\n\n1.   Where a product is covered by a harmonised technical specification adopted in accordance with Articles 5 or 6, the manufacturer shall undergo the applicable assessment and verification system set out in Annex IX and draw up a declaration of performance and conformity before such a product is placed on the market. Where a product is covered by a harmonised technical specification adopted in accordance with Article 7, the manufacturer shall also verify the product’s compliance with applicable product requirements that have been specified by delegated acts. The manufacturer of a product which is not covered by any harmonised technical specification may issue a declaration of performance and conformity in accordance with the relevant European assessment document and European technical assessment.\n\n2.   By drawing up the declaration of performance and conformity, the manufacturer assumes responsibility for the conformity of the product with its declared performance and any applicable product requirements, and becomes liable in accordance with Union and national laws on contractual and extra-contractual liability. In the absence of objective indications to the contrary, Member States shall presume the declaration of performance and conformity drawn up by the manufacturer to be accurate and reliable.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance, or in the absence of a declaration of performance and conformity when such a declaration is required, the product may not be made available on the market.\n\nArticle 14\n\nExemptions from drawing up a declaration of performance and conformity\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 13(1), a manufacturer may decide not to undergo the applicable assessment and verification of the product’s compliance with applicable product requirements and not to draw up a declaration of performance and conformity when any of the following applies:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe product is individually manufactured or custom-made and fulfils all of the following conditions:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nit is manufactured using a non-series process;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nit is produced in response to a specific order;\n\n(iii)\n\n\t\n\nit is installed in a single identified construction work by a manufacturer who is also responsible for the safe incorporation of the product into the construction work; and\n\n(iv)\n\n\t\n\nit is in compliance with the applicable national rules, and under the supervision of those responsible for the safe execution of the construction works designated under the applicable national rules;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe product is manufactured in a manner exclusively appropriate to heritage conservation and in a non-series process for adequately renovating construction works officially protected as part of a designated environment or because of their special architectural or historic merit, in compliance with the applicable national rules.\n\nArticle 15\n\nContent of the declaration of performance and conformity\n\n1.   The declaration of performance and conformity shall be drawn up using the model set out in Annex V. The declaration of performance and conformity shall express the performance of products in relation to the essential characteristics of those products in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specifications or European assessment document.\n\nWhere product requirements specified in accordance with Article 7 are applicable, the declaration of performance and conformity shall state that the fulfilment of those requirements has been demonstrated.\n\n2.   The declaration of performance and conformity shall include the product’s environmental sustainability performance over its life cycle in respect of the predetermined environmental essential characteristics listed in Annex II for those characteristics that are declared. The performance shall include the packaging used or most likely to be used and shall be calculated using the latest version of software made available free of charge on the website of the Commission.\n\nUpdates of the software referred to in the first subparagraph shall become mandatory for the purposes of this Regulation one year after their publication. Such software updates may be voluntarily applied from their date of publication.\n\n3.   The declaration of performance and conformity shall cover at least a product’s performance over its life cycle with regard to the following essential characteristics:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nessential characteristics listed in points (a) to (d) of Annex II, from 8 January 2026;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nessential characteristics listed in points (e) to (m), of Annex II, from 9 January 2030;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nessential characteristics listed in points (n) to (s), of Annex II, from 9 January 2032.\n\nThe declaration of performance and conformity shall also cover those essential characteristics which always have to be declared, as determined in delegated acts adopted in accordance with Article 5(5).\n\n4.   No marking other than the CE marking may be placed on the declaration of performance and conformity.\n\n5.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to amend the model set out in Annex V to adapt it to reflect technical progress as regards new information needs, to facilitate the fulfilment of digital product passport requirements set out in Articles 76 and 77, and to ensure interoperability and correct integration with the construction digital product passport system in accordance with Article 75.\n\n6.   The information referred to in Article 31 or, as the case may be, in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27) shall be provided together with the declaration of performance and conformity.\n\nArticle 16\n\nSupply of the declaration of performance and conformity\n\n1.   The manufacturer shall supply by electronic means a copy of the declaration of performance and conformity of each product which is made available on the market, unless the declaration is included in a digital product passport that fulfils the conditions set out in Article 76 and is available through the construction digital product passport system established in accordance with Article 75.\n\nHowever, where a batch of the same product is supplied to a single user, it may be accompanied by a single copy of the declaration of performance and conformity.\n\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, a manufacturer may make the declaration of performance and conformity referred to in Article 13(1) available on a website, provided that the manufacturer complies with all of the following conditions:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nensures that the content of the declaration of performance and conformity is made available in an unamendable electronic format on the website;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nprovides the declaration of performance and conformity in a human- and machine-readable format and offers the possibility to download a copy in a commonly readable format;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nensures that the website where the declaration of performance and conformity has been made available is monitored and maintained so that the website and the declarations of performance and conformity are continuously available to recipients of the construction product;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nensures that the recipients of construction products are able to access the declaration of performance and conformity free of charge;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nprovides instructions to the recipients of construction products on how to access the website and the declarations of performance and conformity drawn up for such products available on that website;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nprovides a link between the product and the declaration of performance and conformity related to it through the unique identification code of the product type; manufacturers may use a data carrier, including a permalink, to provide the link, provided that point (a) is complied with.\n\n3.   As part of the standardisation request referred to in Article 5(2), the Commission may also request the European standardisation organisation to issue guidelines to ensure interoperability of the human- and machine readable formats referred to in paragraph 2, point (b) of this Article.\n\n4.   The manufacturer shall supply or make available in a digital product passport in accordance with paragraph 1, or on a website in accordance with paragraph 2, the declaration of performance and conformity in the language or languages required by each of the Member States in which the manufacturer intends to make the product available. Another economic operator who makes that manufacturer’s product available in any additional Member State shall make a translation or translations of the declaration of performance and conformity available in the languages required by the additional Member State, together with the respective original version.\n\nArticle 17\n\nGeneral principles and use of CE marking\n\n1.   The CE marking shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.\n\n2.   The CE marking shall be affixed only to those products for which the manufacturer has drawn up a declaration of performance and conformity in accordance with Articles 13 and 15. The CE marking shall be affixed to key parts.\n\n3.   By affixing the CE marking to the product, or having it affixed, the economic operator indicates that it has assumed responsibility for the conformity of the product with the declared performance and applicable product requirements laid down in accordance with this Regulation. By affixing the CE marking, the economic operator becomes liable for the declared performance and the fulfilment of those requirements in accordance with national law on contractual and extra-contractual liability.\n\n4.   The CE marking shall be the only marking attesting to the performance of the product with regard to assessed essential characteristics in accordance with this Regulation, as well as to the conformity of the product with this Regulation.\n\nArticle 18\n\nRules and conditions for the affixing of CE marking\n\n1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the product. Where this is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the product, the CE marking shall be affixed to a label attached to the product or to the packaging or, where that is also not possible, to the accompanying documents.\n\n2.   The CE marking shall be followed by:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe last two digits of the year in which the CE marking was first affixed; or, in the case of used products, the last two digits of the year when the product was deinstalled followed by the last two digits of the year in which the CE marking was affixed to the used product;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe name and the registered address, or the identifying mark allowing easy and unambiguous identification of the name and address, of the manufacturer;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe name and the registered address of the authorised representative, or the identifying mark allowing easy and unambiguous identification of the name and address of the authorised representative where the manufacturer does not have a place of business in the Union or where the manufacturer chooses to have an authorised representative;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe unique identification code of the product-type;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe declaration code of the declaration of performance and conformity;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthe identification number of the notified body or bodies verifying the product type and assessing the factory production control, if applicable; and\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\na data carrier connected to the digital product passport referred to in Article 76 if such a digital product passport is available through the construction digital product passport system established pursuant to Article 75.\n\nThe information listed in points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph may be replaced by a data carrier, including permalink connected to the declaration of performance and conformity pursuant to Article 16(2), point (e), if the declaration of performance and conformity is available on a website. The information listed in points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph may be omitted if a data carrier referred to in point (g) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph is provided.\n\n3.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the product is placed on the market. It may be followed by a pictogram or any other mark indicating a special risk or use.\n\nArticle 19\n\nOther markings and performance claims\n\n1.   Markings other than the CE marking, including private ones, may be affixed to a product only if they do not indicate that the product’s performance in relation to essential characteristics covered by applicable harmonised technical specifications had to be assessed in a way different from that laid down by this Regulation.\n\nOfficially recognised EN ISO 14024 type I ecolabels may be affixed to a product if they fulfil the requirement in the first subparagraph.\n\n2.   Markings allowed in accordance with paragraph 1 and other markings set out by Union legislation may be affixed to a product provided that they do not impair the visibility, legibility and meaning of the CE marking.\n\n3.   Where a product is covered by a harmonised technical specification, a claim made by an economic operator about the product’s performance, which concerns an essential characteristic covered by that harmonised technical specification, shall comply with the assessment method for that particular essential characteristic as laid down in the harmonised technical specifications.\n\n4.   Where a product is covered by harmonised technical specifications, claims about its performance in relation to the essential characteristics laid down in those harmonised technical specifications may be additionally provided in a place other than in the declaration of performance and conformity only if they are already provided in the declaration of performance and conformity.\n\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply to situations where, in accordance with Article 14, no declaration of performance and conformity has been drawn up.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS\n\nArticle 20\n\nObligations of all economic operators\n\n1.   The obligations of economic operators under this Chapter are applicable only in relation to products covered by a harmonised technical specification, or to products that have been CE-marked on the basis of a European technical assessment.\n\n2.   An economic operator shall take all necessary measures to ensure continued compliance with this Regulation. Where non-compliance of the economic operator or of a product has been stated and corrective action has been requested by a market surveillance authority in accordance with Article 65(1), the economic operator shall submit progress reports to that authority until that authority decides that the corrective action can be closed.\n\n3.   An economic operator shall, on request of a competent national authority, identify to that authority any economic operator or other actor:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nwho has supplied that economic operator with a product, including components or spare parts of products, and the quantity of that supply, or who has supplied it with a service covered by this Regulation;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nto whom that economic operator has supplied a product, including components or spare parts of products, and the quantity of that supply, or to whom it has supplied a service covered by this Regulation.\n\nWhen identifying the economic operators or other actors referred to in the first subparagraph, an economic operator shall inform the competent national authority of, at least, the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe contact details, including addresses and email addresses of those economic operators or actors;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe tax and company registration numbers of those economic operators or actors.\n\n4.   An economic operator shall keep all documents and all information referred to in this Chapter at the disposal of competent national authorities for a period of 10 years after the economic operator supplied or was supplied with the product or service in question, unless the documents or the information have been made available through the digital product passport referred to in Article 76. An economic operator shall present the documentation and information within 10 days of receipt of a request by a competent national authority.\n\n5.   An economic operator may register itself in its respective national system established in accordance with Article 71(5).\n\nAn economic operator shall make available to consumers and users communication channels, including telephone numbers, email addresses or dedicated sections of its website, allowing them to communicate any accident, other incident or safety issue they have experienced with the product.\n\n6.   Where an economic operator considers that a non-conforming product presents a risk to health and safety of persons or to the environment, it shall immediately inform thereof the competent national authorities of the Member States in which it made the product available, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken. An economic operator may inform the competent national authorities of any other likely infringement of this Regulation of which it becomes aware, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n\n7.   An economic operator shall be liable for infringements of this Article or of the Articles in this Chapter related to its activities, in accordance with national law on contractual and extra-contractual liability.\n\nArticle 21\n\nRights of manufacturers\n\n1.   A manufacturer shall have the right to request from its suppliers and service providers the information necessary in relation to their products to fulfil its obligations under this Regulation.\n\n2.   If the manufacturer is subject to third-party tasks carried out by a notified body, the manufacturer shall have the right to request from its suppliers or service providers that they permit that notified body to have access to their documentation and to their premises to the extent that the notified body requires such access in order to carry out its tasks.\n\n3.   The rights established in paragraph 1 also apply to a manufacturer placing a used or remanufactured product on the market in relation to the supplier of the used product, including the deinstaller where applicable. The information required may include, but is not limited to, information about the previous use of the product and about the process of deinstalling it.\n\n4.   A manufacturer shall have the right to request from its suppliers and service providers the data and calculations required under Article 15(2) in relation to the supplies or services provided, including the necessary validation reports issued by a notified body.\n\nArticle 22\n\nObligations of manufacturers\n\n1.   When placing a product on the market, the manufacturer shall determine the product type, respecting the boundaries set up therefor by the definition provided in Article 3, point (27). The manufacturer shall ensure that the product’s performance is assessed in relation to both mandatory essential characteristics and those essential characteristics intended to be declared.

The manufacturer shall, to that effect, provide all useful details and, in particular, specify the type of the non-compliance, the frequency of accidents or incidents, and the corrective measures taken or recommended. In the case of risks caused by products which have already reached an end user or consumer who cannot be identified or contacted directly, the manufacturer shall, through the media and other appropriate channels, ensuring the widest possible reach, disseminate information about appropriate measures to eliminate or, if not possible, to reduce the risks. Where there is a serious risk the manufacturer shall withdraw and recall the product at its own cost.\n\nArticle 23\n\nObligations of authorised representatives\n\n1.   A manufacturer established in the Union may appoint, by a written mandate, any natural or legal person established within the Union as a single authorised representative.

The notified bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of the undertaking, the sector in which the undertaking operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.\n\nIn so doing, the notified bodies shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour required for the product by this Regulation and the part played by the product for the fulfilment of all basic requirements for construction works.\n\n3.   Where, in the course of the initial inspection of the manufacturing plant and of factory production control, a notified body finds that the manufacturer has not ensured the constancy of performance and conformity of the manufactured product, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue a certificate or a validation report.\n\n4.   Where, in the course of the monitoring activity aiming at the verification of conformity and of the constancy of performance of the manufactured product, a notified body finds that a product no longer has the same performance to that of the product-type, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw the certificate or the validation report if necessary.\n\n5.   Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates or validation reports, as appropriate.\n\n6.   When taking assessment decisions, including when deciding on the need to suspend or withdraw a certificate or validation report in light of possible instances of non-compliance, notified bodies shall apply clear and pre-determined criteria.\n\n7.   When requested by a manufacturer or provider to do so, notified bodies shall cooperate and share all relevant information with notified bodies that have recognised its assessments and verifications in accordance with Article 62. Notified bodies shall establish an agreement for that purpose.\n\nArticle 56\n\nInformation obligations of notified bodies\n\n1.   Notified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nany refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of certificates, validation reports or test reports;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nany circumstances affecting the scope of, and conditions for, notification;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nany request for information on assessment or verification activities carried out which they have received from competent national authorities; and\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\non request, third-party tasks in accordance with the assessment and verification systems carried out within the scope of their notification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and subcontracting.\n\n2.   Notified bodies shall provide the other bodies notified under this Regulation which carry out similar third-party tasks in accordance with the assessment and verification systems and for products covered by the same harmonised technical specification or the same European assessment document with relevant information on issues relating to negative results from these assessments and verifications, in particular, any refusal, restriction, suspension, or withdrawal of certificates, validation reports or of test reports, and, upon request, positive results from those assessments.\n\nA notified body shall, upon request from another notified body, a competent national authority or the Commission inform the requesting party whether certificates, validation reports or test reports issued by it are valid, restricted, suspended or withdrawn.\n\n3.   Where the Commission or a competent national authority of a Member State submits a request to a notified body established on the territory of another Member State relating to an assessment carried out by that notified body, it shall send a copy of that request to the notifying authority of that other Member State. The notified body concerned shall respond without delay and within 15 days at the latest to the request. The notifying authority shall ensure that such requests are resolved by the notified body unless there is a legitimate reason for not doing so.\n\n4.   Where notified bodies have or receive evidence that:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nanother notified body does not comply with the requirements laid down in Article 46 or its obligations;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\na product placed on the market does not comply with this Regulation;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\na product placed on the market, due to its physical condition, is likely to cause a serious risk,\n\nthey shall alert and share such evidence with the relevant market surveillance authority or notifying authority, as appropriate.\n\nArticle 57\n\nImplementing acts on notified bodies’ obligations\n\nWhere this is necessary to ensure a harmonised application of this Regulation and where the coordination group of notifying and designating authorities have not been able to resolve a dispute concerning their diverging practices, in accordance with Article 45, and only to the extent necessary to prevent diverging practices fragmenting the internal market for economic operators, the Commission may adopt implementing acts providing details on how to execute the obligations of notified bodies contained in Articles 55 and 56.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).\n\nArticle 58\n\nCoordination of notified bodies\n\n1.   The Commission shall ensure that appropriate coordination and cooperation between bodies notified under this Regulation are put into place and properly operated in the form of a group of notified bodies.\n\nNotified bodies shall participate in the work of that group, directly or by means of designated representatives. Notifying authorities shall ensure that notified bodies participate in the work of that group.\n\n2.   Notified bodies shall apply as general guidance any relevant documents produced as a result of the work of the group referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n3.   Coordination and cooperation in the group referred to in paragraph 1 shall aim to ensure the harmonised application of this Regulation.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES\n\nArticle 59\n\nReplacement of type-testing and type-calculation\n\n1.   A manufacturer may replace type-testing or type-calculation with a specific section in the technical documentation referred to in Article 22(3) demonstrating that:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nfor one or several essential characteristics of the product, which the manufacturer places on the market, that product is deemed to achieve a certain level or class of performance without testing or calculation, or without further testing or calculation, in accordance with the conditions set out in the delegated acts referred to in Article 5(6); or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe product, covered by a harmonised technical specification or a European assessment document, which the manufacturer places on the market is a system made of components, which the manufacturer duly assembles following precise instructions, including compatibility criteria in the case of individual components, given by the provider of such a system or of a component thereof, who has already tested that system or that component for one or several of its essential characteristics in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specification or European assessment document. When these conditions are satisfied and when the manufacturer has notably verified that the precise compatibility criteria of the provider are met, the manufacturer is entitled to declare performance corresponding to all or part of the test results provided to it for the system or the component;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe product, covered by a harmonised technical specification or by a European technical assessment, which the manufacturer places on the market, corresponds to a product-type of a product manufactured by another manufacturer and is already subject to type-testing or type-calculation.\n\nWhen the conditions in point (c) are satisfied, the manufacturer may declare the performance corresponding to all or part of the results of this other product. The manufacturer shall only apply this simplification after having obtained an authorisation of the other manufacturer, who remains responsible for the accuracy, reliability and stability of those test results.\n\n2.   If the assessment and verification system applicable includes a performance assessment by a notified body as set out in Annex IX, a notified body or TAB shall, in place of the assessment of the performance of the product set out in Annex IX, assess and certify the correct fulfilment of the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\nArticle 60\n\nUse of simplified procedures by micro-enterprises\n\n1.   A micro-enterprise may replace type-testing or type-calculation for an essential characteristic under assessment and verification system 3 set out in point 5 of Annex IX with a specific section in the technical documentation referred to in Article 22(3) providing data equivalent to the assessment required for this essential characteristic in accordance with the applicable harmonised technical specifications or European assessment document.\n\n2.   A notified body or TAB shall, instead of the assessment of the performance of the product set out in Annex IX, assess and certify the correct fulfilment of the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\nArticle 61\n\nCustom-made non-series products\n\n1.   As an alternative to the exemption in Article 14, point (a), a manufacturer of a product that fulfils the conditions in Article 14, point (a), may replace the performance assessment of the product with a specific section in the technical documentation referred to in Article 22(3) demonstrating the compliance of that product with the applicable requirements and providing data equivalent to the data required by this Regulation and the applicable harmonised technical specifications or European assessment document.\n\n2.   If the assessment and verification system applicable includes a performance assessment by a notified body as set out in Annex IX, a notified body or TAB shall, in place of the assessment of the performance of the product set out in Annex IX, assess and certify the correct fulfilment of the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\nArticle 62\n\nRecognition of assessment and verification by another notified body\n\n1.   When a notified body is to assess and verify a certain product in accordance with Annex IX, it may refrain from the assessment and verification and recognise the assessment and verification undertaken by another notified body for the same economic operator where all of the following conditions apply:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe product has been correctly assessed and verified by the other notified body;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe assessed or verified economic operator agrees to share all relevant data and documents with the recognising notified body; and\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe validity of the certificate is limited to the validity of the certificate issued by the other notified body.\n\nThis paragraph shall also apply to validation reports and to assessments of calculation of the environmental sustainability undertaken under Regulation (EU) 2024/1781.\n\n2.   When a notified body is to assess and verify a certain product in accordance with Annex IX, it may refrain from the assessment and verification of its parts or materials and recognise the results of the assessment and verification by another notified body, if the provider of those parts or materials applied the required assessment and verification system to them and there is an agreement between the manufacturer of the product and the provider that ensures the free flow of all information between them and the notified bodies in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n\nThis paragraph shall also apply to assessments of the calculation of the environmental sustainability undertaken under Regulation (EU) 2024/1781.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMARKET SURVEILLANCE AND SAFEGUARD PROCEDURES\n\nArticle 63\n\nComplaint portal\n\n1.   Without prejudice to the obligations of economic operators under this Regulation and the activities of market surveillance authorities under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the Commission shall set up a system allowing any natural or legal person to share complaints or reports related to possible non-compliance with this Regulation.\n\n2.   Where the Commission considers a complaint or report relevant and substantiated based on clearly defined criteria, it shall without undue delay transmit that complaint or report to the single liaison point of the Member State concerned for that single liaison point to follow-up with the relevant natural or legal person in accordance with Article 11(7), point (a) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.\n\nArticle 64\n\nMarket surveillance authorities and single liaison point\n\n1.   Member States shall designate, amongst their market surveillance authorities, one or more authorities that dispose of the particular knowledge needed to assess products both technically and legally.\n\n2.   Member States shall designate a single liaison point to act as the focal point for contacts with the Commission and single liaison points of other Member States which are competent under this Regulation, including for requests pursuant to Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.\n\n3.   Market surveillance authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall have all the powers listed in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. For the purposes of this Regulation those powers shall also apply to all economic operators covered by this Regulation.\n\n4.   For the purpose of market surveillance, investigation and enforcement, market surveillance authorities shall have the power to request from other authorities or bodies relevant information in their possession.\n\nArticle 65\n\nProcedure to deal with non-compliance\n\n1.   Where a market surveillance authority of one Member State has sufficient reason to believe that certain products covered by a harmonised technical specification or for which a European technical assessment has been issued, or their manufacturer, are non-compliant, it shall carry out an evaluation in relation to those products and the manufacturer concerned covering the respective requirements laid down by this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall, as necessary, cooperate with the market surveillance authorities.\n\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the products or their manufacturer do not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take appropriate and proportionate corrective actions, as provided for in Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, to bring the non-compliance to an end or, if that is not possible, to withdraw the products from the market, or to recall them, all within a reasonable period which is commensurate with the nature of the non-compliance.\n\nThe market surveillance authority shall inform the notified bodies accordingly, if notified bodies are involved.\n\n2.   Where the market surveillance authority considers that the non-compliance is not limited to its national territory, it shall, via the single liaison point, inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the economic operator to take.\n\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the products concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator, within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, does not take the corrective action referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, or where the non-compliance persists, the market surveillance authority shall ensure that the product concerned is withdrawn or recalled, or that making it available on the market is prohibited or restricted.\n\nThe market surveillance authority shall inform the public, and via the single liaison point the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n\n5.   The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant products, the origin of those products, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of national measures taken as well as the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to any of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nfailure of the products to achieve the declared performance;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nfailure of the products to meet product requirements established by delegated acts referred to in Article 7(1);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nfailure of the manufacturer to meet obligations;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nshortcomings in the harmonised technical specifications, in a European assessment document, in the voluntary harmonised standards for product requirements the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 7(5) or (6) or in the common specifications established by implementing acts referred to in Article 8(1).\n\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the products concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.\n\n7.   Where, within two months of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State in relation to the product concerned, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken without delay in respect of the product or manufacturer concerned, such as withdrawal of the products from their market.\n\nArticle 66\n\nUnion safeguard procedure\n\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 65(4), (6) and (7), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator and shall evaluate the national measure. The consultation period shall not exceed two months. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall endeavour to adopt implementing acts, within two additional months, after the end of consultation period, setting out its decision as to whether the measure is justified or not.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred in Article 90(2).\n\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator.\n\n2.   If the national measure is considered to be justified, all Member States shall, without delay, ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal, are taken in respect of the non-compliant product and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered to be unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.\n\n3.   Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product or its manufacturer is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised technical specifications, European assessment documents, voluntary harmonised standards or common specifications established by implementing acts as referred to in Article 65(5), point (d), the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 5(9), Article 6(5), Article 7(6) or Article 36 of this Regulation or in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, as appropriate.\n\nArticle 67\n\nCompliant products which nevertheless present a risk\n\n1.   Where, having performed an evaluation pursuant to Article 65(1), a market surveillance authority finds that, although a product is in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons or, where applicable, to the environment or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the products concerned, when placed on the market, no longer present that risk, to withdraw the products from the market or to recall them within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, which it may prescribe.\n\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that any corrective action is taken in respect of all the products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n\n3.   The market surveillance authority shall, via the single liaison point, immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the product concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the product, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n\n4.   The Commission shall without delay consult the Member States and the relevant economic operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act setting out its decision whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, ordering appropriate measures.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 90(2).\n\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator.\n\nArticle 68\n\nMarket surveillance coordination and support\n\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the administrative cooperation group set up pursuant to Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 (‘ADCO’) shall meet at regular intervals and, where necessary, at the reasoned request of the Commission or of two or more participating market surveillance authorities.\n\nIn the context of performing its tasks set out in Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the ADCO shall support the implementation of this Regulation, namely by identifying common priorities for market surveillance.\n\n2.   Based on priorities identified in consultation with the ADCO, the Commission shall:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\norganise joint market surveillance and testing projects in areas of common interest;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\norganise joint investment in market surveillance capacities, including equipment and IT tools;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\norganise common trainings for the staff of market surveillance authorities, notifying authorities and notified bodies, including on the correct interpretation and application of this Regulation and on methods and techniques relevant for applying or verifying compliance with it;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\ndraw up guidelines for the application and enforcement of this Regulation, including requirements and obligations set out in harmonised technical specifications adopted pursuant to this Regulation, as well as common practices and methodologies for effective market surveillance.\n\nThe Union shall, where appropriate, finance the actions referred to in points (a), (b) and (c).\n\n3.   The Commission shall provide technical and logistic support to ensure that the ADCO fulfils its tasks set out in this Article and in Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.\n\nArticle 69\n\nRecovery of costs\n\nWhere a product has been found to be non-compliant, market surveillance authorities shall have the right to recover from the economic operators who placed or made the product available on the market the costs of document inspection and physical product testing, provided that those costs are accompanied by a justification.\n\nArticle 70\n\nReporting and benchmarking\n\n1.   Market surveillance authorities shall enter into the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 information on the nature and severity of any penalty imposed in relation to non-compliance with this Regulation.\n\n2.   Every four years, by 30 June, the Commission shall, draw up a report based on the information entered by market surveillance authorities into the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. The first of those reports shall be published by 9 January 2030.\n\nThe report shall include:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ninformation on the nature and number of checks performed by market surveillance authorities during the four previous calendar years pursuant to Article 34(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\ninformation on the levels of non-compliance identified and on the nature and severity of penalties imposed for the four previous calendar years in relation to products covered by harmonised technical specifications or CE marked based on a European technical assessment;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nindicative benchmarks for market surveillance authorities in relation to the frequency of checks and the nature and severity of penalties imposed.\n\n3.   The Commission shall publish the report referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article in the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and shall make public a summary of the report.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nINFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\n\nArticle 71\n\nInformation systems for harmonised decision-making\n\n1.   The Commission shall establish and maintain an information and communication system for the collection, processing and storage of information, in a structured form, on issues relating to the interpretation or application of the rules laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation, with the aim of ensuring the harmonised application of those rules.\n\nIn addition to the Commission and Member States, market surveillance authorities, the single liaison offices appointed under Article 10(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the authorities designated under Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, notifying authorities, representatives of the group of notified bodies and of the organisation of TABs, and product contact points for construction shall be able to access the information and communication system.\n\n2.   The bodies listed in paragraph 1 may use the information and communication system to raise any question or issue related to the interpretation or application of the rules laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation, including their relationship to other provisions of Union law.\n\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the bodies listed in paragraph 1 may raise questions or issues related to the following topics:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe application or interpretation by any other body of the rules laid down in, or pursuant to, this Regulation in a way that diverges from their own practice;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nquestions or issues raised through the information and communication system related to the situation they are confronted with or to their own practice;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nsituations not foreseen by the rules laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation when first published or referred to in the Official Journal of the European Union, especially but not limited to situations brought about by the emergence of new products or business models;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nwhether the rules laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation apply to a situation to which other provisions of Union law also apply and the resulting question of which rules are to prevail.\n\n4.   When raising a question or issue, the relevant body shall enter into the information and communication system information concerning:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nany decision taken in relation to the question or issue raised;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe rationale behind the approach taken;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nany alternative approach it has identified and its rationale.\n\n5.   Member States shall establish a national information system or email distribution service to inform their competent national authorities, the economic operators active on their territory, TABs and notified bodies with place of business on their territory and, on request, also other TABs and notified bodies, on all matters relevant for the correct interpretation or application of the rules laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation. In doing so, they shall take into account the information available in the information and communications system referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n6.   Competent national authorities, TABs and notified bodies with a place of business in the respective Member State shall register themselves in the system or for the email distribution service and take account of all information transmitted via them. Economic operators may register themselves in the system or for the email distribution service. Member States shall take appropriate measures to bring the system or email distribution service to the attention of economic operators.\n\n7.   The national information system or email distribution service shall be able to receive complaints from any natural or legal person, including TABs and notified bodies, on the uneven application of the rules laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation.

To that end, the references of European standards or references of relevant applicable international or national standards may be published in those implementing acts or, if there is no European standard or no relevant applicable international or national standard, common specifications may be established by those implementing acts.\n\n3.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3) and shall apply until the last day of the period during which the internal market emergency mode is activated, unless those implementing acts are amended or repealed in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article.\n\n4.   Before preparing the draft implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers that the conditions in paragraph 1 of this Article have been fulfilled. When preparing that draft implementing act, the Commission shall take into account the views of the CPR Acquis Expert Group and shall duly consult all relevant stakeholders.\n\n5.   Without prejudice to Articles 13 and 15, the methods and the criteria provided in the standards or common specifications referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, or parts thereof, may be used for assessing and declaring the performance of construction products covered by those standards or common specifications in relation to their essential characteristics. From the day following the expiry or deactivation of the internal market emergency mode it shall no longer be possible to draw up declarations of performance and conformity based on the standards or the common specifications referred to in the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n6.   By way of derogation from Article 85(3), unless there is sufficient reason to believe that construction products covered by the standards or common specifications referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article present a risk to the health or safety of persons or fail to achieve the declared performance, the declarations of performance and conformity of construction products which have been placed on the market in compliance with those standards or common specifications shall remain valid after the expiry or repeal of an implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article and after the expiry or deactivation of the internal market emergency mode.\n\n7.   Where a Member State considers that a standard or common specification as referred to in paragraph 1 is incorrect in terms of methods and criteria for the assessment of performance in relation to essential characteristics, it shall inform the Commission thereof by submitting a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that detailed explanation and, may, where appropriate, amend or repeal the implementing act listing the standard or establishing the common specification in question.\n\nArticle 88\n\nPrioritisation of market surveillance activities and mutual assistance among authorities\n\n1.   Member States shall prioritise the market surveillance activities for construction products listed in the implementing act referred to in Article 85(1) of this Regulation. The Commission shall facilitate coordination of such prioritisation efforts through the Union Product Compliance Network established under Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.\n\n2.   The market surveillance authorities of the Member States shall ensure that best efforts are made to provide assistance to other market surveillance authorities during an internal market emergency mode, including by mobilising and dispatching expert teams to temporarily reinforce the staff of market surveillance authorities requesting assistance or by providing logistical support, such as the reinforcement of the testing capacity for construction products listed in the implementing act referred to in Article 85(1).\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 89\n\nDelegated acts\n\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n\n2.   The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 4(7), Article 5(5), (6) and (10), Article 7(1), and (8), Article 9(3) and (4), Article 10(2),and (4), Article 12, Article 15(5), Article 22(8) and (9), Article 32(5), Article 75(1), Article 80(2) and Article 83(1)shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 7 January 2025.

That evaluation shall, inter alia, assess the correlation of this Regulation with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 and the potential environmental and economic benefits and the impact of extended producer responsibility of manufacturers of certain construction products and of the regain of ownership of surplus and unsold products at Union level. The Commission shall also evaluate the effect of the application of this Regulation on the state of the market for different categories of used products. The Commission shall evaluate whether the penalties applied by the Member States are effective and whether they create fragmentation in the internal market. The Commission shall, if necessary, suggest how to harmonise those penalties.\n\nThe Commission shall present a report on the main findings to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions. Member States shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of that report.\n\nWhere appropriate, the report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal for the amendment of the relevant provisions of this Regulation.\n\nArticle 94\n\nRepeal\n\nRegulation (EU) No 305/2011 is repealed with effect from 8 January 2026, with the exception of Article 2, Articles 4 to 9, Articles 11 to 18, Articles 27 and 28, Articles 36 to 40, Articles 47 to 49, Articles 52 and 53, Article 55, Articles 60 to 64 of that Regulation and Annexes III and V thereto which are repealed with effect from 8 January 2040.\n\nReferences to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex XI to this Regulation.\n\nArticle 95\n\nDerogations and transitional provisions\n\n1.   Product contact points for construction designated under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 shall be deemed to have been designated under this Regulation as well.\n\n2.   TABs and notified bodies that are designated or notified under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 shall be deemed to have been designated or notified under this Regulation as well.

    "texte": "REGULATION (EU) 2024/3011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\nof 27 November 2024\n\non the transfer of proceedings in criminal matters\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82(1), second subparagraph, points (b) and (d), thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nThe Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThe Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union (3) requires Member States to consider possibilities for concentrating the prosecution in cross-border multilateral cases in one Member State, with a view to increasing the efficiency of prosecutions while guaranteeing the proper administration of justice.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nThe Programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters (4) calls for an instrument enabling criminal proceedings to be transferred to other Member States.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nFurther development of judicial cooperation between Member States is needed to increase the efficient and proper administration of criminal justice within the common area of freedom, security and justice and to ensure that the best-placed Member State investigates or prosecutes a criminal offence. In particular, common rules for Member States regarding the transfer of criminal proceedings could help to prevent unnecessary parallel criminal proceedings in different Member States in respect of the same facts and the same person, which could result in an infringement of the ne bis in idem principle. Such common rules could also reduce the number of multiple criminal proceedings in respect of the same facts or in respect of the same person being conducted in different Member States. Such common rules also aim to ensure that it is possible for a transfer of criminal proceedings to take place if the surrender of a person for criminal prosecution under a European arrest warrant, pursuant to Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA (5), is delayed or refused for reasons such as the existence of ongoing parallel criminal proceedings in another Member State for the same criminal offence, in order to avoid impunity of the person being prosecuted.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nCommon rules on the transfer of criminal proceedings are also essential in order to fight cross-border crime efficiently, which is especially important in relation to crimes committed by organised criminal groups, such as drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, firearms trafficking, environmental crime, cybercrime or money laundering. Prosecuting organised criminal groups that are active in multiple Member States can create great difficulties for the authorities involved. The transfer of criminal proceedings is an important tool which would reinforce the fight against organised criminal groups that are active across the Union.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure effective cooperation between requesting authorities and requested authorities in relation to the transfer of criminal proceedings, rules on such transfer should be established by a legally binding and directly applicable act of the Union.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should apply to all requests for transfer issued within the framework of criminal proceedings.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nCouncil Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA (6) aims to prevent situations where the same person is subject to parallel criminal proceedings in different Member States in respect of the same facts, which might lead to the final disposal of those proceedings in two or more Member States. That Framework Decision therefore establishes a procedure for direct consultations between competent authorities of the Member States concerned with the aim of reaching a consensus on any effective solution aimed at avoiding the adverse consequences arising from such parallel proceedings and the waste of time and resources of those competent authorities. Where those competent authorities decide, following consultations in accordance with that Framework Decision, to concentrate proceedings in one Member State through the transfer of criminal proceedings, such transfer should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nOther legal acts in the area of criminal matters, particularly those related to specific types of crime such as Directive (EU) 2017/541 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and Council Framework Decisions 2002/475/JHA (8) and 2008/841/JHA (9), include provisions referring to the factors to be taken into account with the aim of centralising criminal proceedings in a single Member State in the event that more than one Member State can validly prosecute on the basis of the same facts. Where the competent authorities of the Member States concerned decide, following cooperation in accordance with such legal acts, to centralise criminal proceedings in a single Member State through the transfer of criminal proceedings, such transfer should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nSeveral Union legal acts have been adopted on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and judicial decisions in criminal matters, in particular Council Framework Decisions 2005/214/JHA (10), 2008/909/JHA (11) and 2008/947/JHA (12). This Regulation supplements those Framework Decisions and does not affect their application.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not affect spontaneous exchanges of information regulated by other Union legal acts.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not apply to decisions to reallocate, merge or split cases in relation to which the European Public Prosecutor’s Office has exercised its competence in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (13).\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, Member States should designate their competent authorities in a way that promotes the principle of direct contact between those authorities.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation and in the interest of facilitating its effective application across the Union, in the event that the structure of the internal legal systems of Member States with common law traditions does not allow for their courts and prosecutors to take measures ancillary to the decision to accept or refuse a transfer of criminal proceedings, another authority, with competence to take measures in criminal proceedings, should be able to take such ancillary measures. The involvement of such competent authority should not prejudice in any way the decision, to be taken exclusively by a judge, court, investigating judge or public prosecutor, on whether to accept or refuse a transfer of criminal proceedings, which should, by necessity, include its assessment of the grounds for refusal under this Regulation. The involvement of any other competent authority is solely intended to facilitate such judicial decision-making and the effective application of this Regulation.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nWhere necessary due to the structure of their internal legal systems, it should be possible for Member States to designate one or more central authorities for the administrative transmission and reception of requests for the transfer of criminal proceedings, as well as for other official correspondence relating to such requests. Such central authorities could also provide administrative support and have coordinating and assisting roles, thereby facilitating and promoting the acceptance of requests for the transfer of criminal proceedings.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nSome Union legal acts already require Member States to take necessary measures to establish jurisdiction over specific criminal offences, such as those related to terrorist activities pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/541 or to the counterfeiting of the euro pursuant to Directive 2014/62/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), in cases where the surrender of a person is refused.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that it is possible for criminal proceedings to be transferred in accordance with this Regulation wherever the interests of efficient and proper administration of justice and the effective protection of the fundamental rights of the suspects, accused persons and victims, as set out in Union law, so require, this Regulation should provide for jurisdiction in specific cases so that the requested State is able to exercise jurisdiction in relation to the criminal offences to which the national law of the requesting State is applicable. The requested State should have jurisdiction over criminal offences for which the transfer of criminal proceedings is sought, whenever that Member State is considered to be best placed to prosecute the criminal offence in question. The rules on jurisdiction provided for in this Regulation should not prevent Member States from adopting national measures to ensure that they are able to exercise jurisdiction in the specific cases provided for in this Regulation.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nIn addition to the jurisdiction already provided for by the national law of the requested State, jurisdiction should be established on the basis of the specific grounds set out in this Regulation wherever that Member State is considered as being best placed to prosecute. The requested State should have jurisdiction in situations where the requested State refuses to surrender a suspect or accused person for whom a European arrest warrant has been issued and who is present in the requested State and is a national of or a resident in that State, where such refusal is based on the specific grounds set out in this Regulation. For example, jurisdiction should be established where surrender is refused on the basis of Article 4, point (7)(b), of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, which applies in situations where offences have been committed outside the territory of the issuing Member State and the law of the executing Member State does not allow prosecution for the same offences when committed outside its territory. That rule could be applied in situations where an offence is committed on the territory of another Member State or of a third country by nationals of other Member States or third-country nationals, and the suspect or accused person is a resident in the requested State. This is of particular importance as regards serious crimes violating fundamental values of the international community, such as war crimes or genocide, where a risk of impunity might arise due to a European arrest warrant being refused on the basis of Article 4, point (7)(b), of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA. The requested State should also have jurisdiction where the criminal offence produces its effects or causes damage mainly in the requested State. Damage should be taken into account provided that it is one of the constituent elements of the criminal offence, in accordance with the national law of the requested State. The requested State should also have jurisdiction when criminal proceedings are already ongoing in that State against the same suspect or accused person in respect of other facts, so that all the alleged criminal conduct of such a person could be judged in one single jurisdiction, or when criminal proceedings are ongoing in that State against other persons in respect of the same, partially the same or related facts, which might be of particular relevance for concentrating the investigation and prosecution of a criminal organisation in one Member State. In both cases, the suspect or accused person in the criminal proceedings being transferred should be a national of or a resident in the requested State.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to fulfil the purpose of this Regulation and to prevent conflicts of jurisdiction, having specific regard to those Member States whose legal systems are based on mandatory prosecution and those where there is mandatory prosecution only for certain criminal offences, the requesting State, when requesting a transfer of criminal proceedings, should be able to waive proceedings for the prosecution of the person concerned for the criminal offence for which the transfer is sought. This Regulation should therefore allow the competent authorities of the requesting State to waive, suspend or discontinue the criminal proceedings brought before them in favour of the Member State identified as being in a better position to prosecute, even where, in accordance with national law, those authorities would be under a duty to prosecute. This should be without prejudice to the provisions on the effects of the transfer of criminal proceedings in the requesting State laid down in this Regulation.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation does not affect procedural rights as set out in the Charter or in other Union legal acts, such as Directives 2010/64/EU (15), 2012/13/EU (16), 2013/48/EU (17), (EU) 2016/343 (18), (EU) 2016/800 (19) and (EU) 2016/1919 (20) of the European Parliament and of the Council, for the Member States bound by them. In particular, the requesting authority should ensure that such rights, as provided for under Union and national law, are respected when requesting a transfer of criminal proceedings under this Regulation.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should ensure that, when applying this Regulation, the needs of vulnerable persons are taken into account. In accordance with the Commission Recommendation of 27 November 2013 on procedural safeguards for vulnerable persons suspected or accused in criminal proceedings (21), vulnerable suspects or accused persons should be understood to mean all suspects or accused persons who are not able to understand or effectively participate in criminal proceedings due to their age, their mental or physical condition or any disabilities they might have.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nSimilarly, Member States should ensure that, when applying this Regulation, the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons subject to pre-trial detention are taken into account, considering, where appropriate, Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/681 (22).\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nA requesting authority should be able to request a transfer of criminal proceedings either on its own initiative, whether or not following consultations with a requested authority, or on a proposal from a suspect or accused person, or on a proposal from a victim. This Regulation should not impose any obligation to request the transfer of or to transfer criminal proceedings. When considering whether a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings should be issued, the requesting authority should assess whether such a transfer would serve the objective of efficient and proper administration of justice, including whether it is proportionate and appropriate for the purpose of the proceedings concerned. That assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis in order to identify the Member State that is best placed to prosecute the criminal offence in question.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nWhen assessing whether a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings is justified, the requesting authority should have regard to several criteria, the priority and weight of which should be based on the facts and merits of each individual case. All the relevant factors should be considered in the best interests of justice. For instance, where the criminal offence has been committed in whole or in part on the territory of the requested State, or most of the effects or a substantial part of the damage caused by the criminal offence, where those effects or that damage forms part of the constituent elements of the criminal offence, occurred on the territory of the requested State, it should be possible for that State to be considered in a better position to prosecute, given that the evidence to be collected, such as testimony from witnesses and victims, or experts’ opinions, are in the requested State and could thus be more easily gathered if the criminal proceedings were transferred. Additionally, the initiation of subsequent proceedings for damages in the requested State would be facilitated if the underlying proceedings establishing criminal responsibility were also held in the same Member State. Similarly, if most of the evidence is located in the requested State, a transfer of criminal proceedings might facilitate the collection and subsequent admissibility of the evidence gathered in accordance with the national law of the requested State.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nWhere one or more suspects or accused persons are nationals of or residents in the requested State, a transfer of criminal proceedings might be justified for the purpose of ensuring the right of the suspect or accused person to be present at the trial, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/343. Similarly, where one or more victims are nationals of or residents in the requested State, a transfer of criminal proceedings might be justified to allow victims to more easily participate in criminal proceedings and to be effectively examined as witnesses during the proceedings. In cases where the surrender of a suspect or accused person for whom a European arrest warrant was issued is refused in the requested State on the grounds specified in this Regulation, a transfer might also be justified when that person is present in the requested State while not being a national of or a resident in that State.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nIt is for the requesting authority to assess, on the basis of material before it, whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect, accused person or victim resides in the requested State. Where only limited information is available, such an assessment should be the subject of consultations between the requesting authority and requested authority in order to confirm residence of the suspect, accused person or victim in the requested State. For the purposes of that assessment, various objective circumstances that could indicate that the person concerned has established the habitual centre of that person’s interests in a particular Member State or has the intention to do so could be of relevance. Reasonable grounds to believe that a person resides in the requested State could exist, in particular, where a person is registered as a resident in the requested State, by holding an identity card or a residence permit, or by registration in an official residence register. Where the person in question is not registered in the requested State, residence could be indicated by the fact that that person manifested the intention to settle in that Member State or has acquired, following a stable period of presence in that Member State, certain connections with it which are of a similar degree as those resulting from establishing a formal residence in that Member State. In order to determine whether, in a specific situation, there are sufficient connections between the person concerned and the requested State giving rise to reasonable grounds to believe that the person concerned resides in that Member State, it is necessary to take into account various objective factors characterising the situation of that person, which include, in particular, the length, nature and conditions of that person’s presence in the requested State or the family or economic connections which that person has with the requested State. A registered vehicle, a bank account, the fact that the person’s stay in the requested State was uninterrupted or other objective factors could be of relevance for determining that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person concerned resides in the requested State. A short visit, a holiday stay, including in a holiday home, or a similar stay in the requested State without any further substantial link is not enough to establish residence in that Member State.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nA transfer of criminal proceedings might also be justified when criminal proceedings are ongoing in the requested State in respect of the same, partially the same or other facts against the suspect or accused person, or when criminal proceedings are ongoing in the requested State in respect of the same, partially the same or related facts against other persons, for example in cases of prosecution of cross-border criminal organisations, where different co-accused persons might be prosecuted in different Member States. Moreover, if the suspect or accused person is serving or is to serve a sentence involving deprivation of liberty in the requested State for another criminal offence, a transfer of criminal proceedings might be justified to ensure the right of the convicted person to be present at the trial for which transfer of criminal proceedings is sought, while serving the sentence in the requested State. The requesting authorities should give due consideration to whether the transfer of criminal proceedings could improve the prospects of social rehabilitation of the person concerned if the sentence were to be enforced in the requested State. For that purpose, the person’s attachment to the requested State, whether that person considers it to be the place of family, as well as linguistic, cultural, social, economic or other links, could be taken into account. Additionally, competent authorities often reach agreements on the concentration of proceedings on the basis of the identification of the best-placed jurisdiction. Such agreements could be reached in coordination meetings of the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23), in bilateral or multilateral meetings without the intervention of Eurojust or following consultations under Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nBefore considering whether to transfer criminal proceedings on the sole ground that most of the evidence is located in the requested State, the requesting authority is encouraged to take into account the possibility of obtaining evidence from other Member States through existing instruments of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, such as, for the Member States bound by it, Directive 2014/41/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (24), and mutual legal assistance.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nSuspects, accused persons or victims should be able to propose that criminal proceedings concerning them be transferred to another Member State. Suspects, accused persons or victims should be able to make such a proposal to the competent authorities either of the requesting State or of the requested State where they consider that there are reasons for which a transfer of criminal proceedings is justified in the interests of justice. For example, such a proposal could be made in the requesting State by a suspect, accused person or victim who is aware that there are ongoing criminal proceedings in the requested State in respect of the same, partially the same or other facts against the same suspect or accused person or in respect of the same, partially the same or related facts against other persons. Such a proposal could be made in the requested State where, for example, a suspect, accused person or victim resides in or is a national of that State, or is aware of proceedings having been opened in respect of the same, partially the same, or other facts concerning the same suspects or accused persons. Although such a proposal should be considered and recorded, it should not impose any obligation on the requesting authority or requested authority to request the transfer of or to transfer criminal proceedings or to engage in consultations with the authority of another Member State for that purpose. If either of those authorities become aware of parallel criminal proceedings on the basis of a proposal for the transfer of criminal proceedings submitted by a suspect, accused person or victim, or a lawyer on their behalf, it is under an obligation to consult with the other authority in accordance with Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nThe requesting authority should inform as soon as possible the suspect or accused person of the intention to issue a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings and should provide for the possibility for such person to state an opinion, including on aspects related to restorative justice, in accordance with applicable national law, to enable the authorities to take into account that person’s legitimate interests before issuing a request for transfer. It is important to provide such information in writing. It should also be possible for the information to be provided orally on condition that the fact that the information has been provided is noted in accordance with the recording procedure under national law. It should be possible for the information to be provided using standard forms. Where the requesting authority considers it necessary, for example in view of the age or the physical or mental condition of the suspect or accused person concerned, the opportunity to state an opinion should be given to that person’s legal representative, where available. When assessing the legitimate interest of the suspect or accused person to be informed about the intention to issue a request for transfer, the requesting authority should take into account the need to ensure confidentiality of an investigation or the risk of prejudicing the investigation against that person, for example whenever it is necessary to safeguard an important public interest, such as in cases where such information could prejudice ongoing covert investigations or seriously harm the national security of the Member State in which the criminal proceedings are instituted. Where the requesting authority cannot locate or reach the suspect or accused person despite reasonable efforts being made, the obligation to inform such person should apply from the moment that the suspect or accused person could be located or reached.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nThe rights of victims set out in Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (25), including the right to information, should be taken into account when applying this Regulation. This Regulation should not be interpreted as preventing Member States from granting victims more extensive rights under national law than those laid down in Union law.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nWhen taking a decision on the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings, the requesting authority should have due regard to the legitimate interests of victims, including their protection and aspects related to restorative justice, and should assess whether the transfer of criminal proceedings might be detrimental for the ability of victims to effectively exercise their rights in the criminal proceedings concerned. That assessment could encompass, for example, consideration of the possibility and arrangements available for victims to testify during trial in the requested State if that is not the Member State where they reside. Furthermore, consideration should be given to the possibility for victims to obtain and provide evidence, for instance from witnesses and experts, to claim compensation or to benefit from witness protection or restorative justice programmes in the requested State. The victims’ rights to compensation should not be prejudiced by the transfer of criminal proceedings. This Regulation does not affect rules on compensation and the restitution of property to victims in national proceedings.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nWhere it is necessary to ensure that the protection provided to the victim in the requesting State is continued in the requested State, competent authorities in the requesting State should consider the issuance of a European protection order in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 606/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26) or, for the Member States bound by it, Directive 2011/99/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (27).\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nOnce the requesting authority intends to issue a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings, it should as soon as possible inform the victims who reside or, in the case of legal persons, that are established in the requesting State and who receive information on the criminal proceedings in accordance with Article 6(1) of Directive 2012/29/EU, as implemented in national law, or, in the case of legal persons, that receive such information in accordance with national law. The requesting authority should provide for the possibility for such persons to state their opinion, in accordance with applicable national law, to enable the authorities to take into account their legitimate interests before issuing a request for transfer. It is important to provide such information in writing. It should also be possible to provide the information orally on condition that the fact that the information has been provided is noted in accordance with the recording procedure under national law. It should be possible for the information to be provided using standard forms or, where there are exceptionally large numbers of victims to be informed, via other means of general information to the public, such as in specific online publication instruments available to judicial authorities under national law. Where the requesting authority considers it necessary, for example in view of the age or the physical or mental condition of the victim concerned, the opportunity to state their opinion should be given to their legal representative, where available. When assessing the legitimate interest of victims to be informed about the intention to issue a request for transfer, the requesting authority should take into account the need to ensure confidentiality of an investigation or the risk of prejudicing the investigation, for instance in cases where such information could prejudice ongoing covert investigations or seriously harm the national security of the requesting State.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nIt should also be possible to use standard forms in certain situations provided for under this Regulation to make it easier for the requesting authority and the requested authority to assist each other in informing the suspect, accused person or victim and seeking their opinion on the intention to issue a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings. The possibility to use such standard forms should not preclude the possibility of direct notifications to suspects, accused persons or victims by the requesting authority or the requested authority.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nThe proper application of this Regulation presupposes communication between the requesting authority and requested authority, which should be encouraged to consult each other whenever appropriate to facilitate the smooth and efficient application of this Regulation, either directly or, where appropriate, via Eurojust.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nThe requesting authority should be able to consult the requested authority prior to issuing a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings when that is necessary, in particular, to determine if the transfer of criminal proceedings would serve the interests of efficient and proper administration of justice, including whether it is proportionate and appropriate for the purpose of the proceedings concerned, as well as if the requested authority is likely to invoke one of the grounds for refusal under this Regulation.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nWhen transmitting a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings, the requesting authority should provide accurate and clear information on the circumstances and conditions underlying the request, as well as any other supporting documentation, with a view to enabling the requested authority to take an informed decision on the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings. The completed request form and, with a view to reducing translation costs and time, at least the essential parts of any written supporting documentation or information should be translated by the requesting authority into an official language of the requested State or any other language accepted by that State in accordance with this Regulation. The essential parts of the documents concerned are those extracts that appear necessary for the requested authority to take an informed decision on the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nAs long as the requested authority has not taken a decision to accept or refuse a transfer of criminal proceedings, the requesting authority should be able to withdraw the request for transfer, for instance when it becomes aware of further elements due to which the transfer no longer appears justified. Information about the withdrawal of the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings should be provided immediately to the requested authority and should be communicated to the suspects or accused persons and the victims, as relevant.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nThe requested authority should inform the requesting authority of its decision on whether to accept or refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings without undue delay and in any event no later than 60 days after the receipt of the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings. In specific cases, when it is not feasible for the requested authority to comply with that time-limit, for instance if it considers that additional information is necessary, it should be possible for the time-limit to be extended only by a maximum of 30 days to avoid excessive delays. When accepting the transfer of criminal proceedings, the requested authority should take a duly reasoned decision. In cases where the requested authority refuses the transfer of criminal proceedings, it should inform the requesting authority of the reasons for refusal. For that purpose, it is sufficient for the requested authority to provide succinct information as to the relevant ground or grounds for refusal.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nWhere the requested authority has accepted the transfer of criminal proceedings, the requesting authority should without undue delay forward to the requested authority originals or certified copies of all documents of the case file, or at least the relevant parts thereof, accompanied by their translation. Once the national proceedings are discontinued, the requesting authority should transmit any remaining relevant parts of the case file in original or certified copy, including relevant physical evidence such as objects of offence or blood or DNA samples, to the requested authority without undue delay. Original documentation should only be transmitted if requested by the requested authority, for instance where there is a need to examine a document for forensic purposes. Provided that the original documents of the case file and the physical evidence are no longer needed in the requested State, they should be returned to the requesting State upon its request, for example if such documents or physical evidence are needed for the purposes of another criminal investigation. Where the requesting State, when asked by the requested State, indicates that it does not intend to recover the original documents of the case file or the physical evidence when it is no longer needed or at the end of the proceedings, the requested State should be able to decide, in accordance with its national law, how to deal with the remaining evidence, including whether to preserve or destroy such evidence. Once a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings has been accepted, and in order to facilitate an efficient transfer, the requesting authority and requested authority should be able to consult each other to determine the necessary documents or parts of such documents to be forwarded, as well as to be translated, where necessary. However, it is important that a decision to send only parts of the documents be balanced and based on a careful consideration of the documents in question so as not to prejudice the fairness of the proceedings.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nTransfer of criminal proceedings should not be refused on grounds other than those provided for in this Regulation. For the transfer of criminal proceedings to be accepted, prosecution of the facts underlying the criminal proceedings that are subject to the transfer should be possible in the requested State. The requested authority should refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings if the conduct for which transfer is sought is not a criminal offence in the requested State, or if the requested State does not have jurisdiction over that criminal offence, unless it exercises jurisdiction provided for under this Regulation. The requested authority should also refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings if the conditions for prosecuting the criminal offence in the requested State are not fulfilled. This could be the case, for example, if a complaint by the victim, which is necessary for prosecuting the criminal offence in the requested State, has not been filed in time, or where, because of the death or insanity of the suspect or accused person, prosecution has become impossible pursuant to the national law of the requested State. Furthermore, the requested authority should refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings if there are other impediments to prosecution in the requested State. The requested authority should be able to refuse a transfer of criminal proceedings if the suspect or accused person benefits from a privilege or immunity in accordance with the national law of the requested State, for example in relation to certain categories of persons, such as diplomats, or specifically protected relationships, such as lawyer-client privilege, or if the requested authority believes that such transfer is not justified by the interests of efficient and proper administration of justice, for instance because none of the criteria for requesting a transfer of criminal proceedings are met, or if the request form for the transfer of criminal proceedings is incomplete or manifestly incorrect and has not been completed or corrected by the requesting authority, thus meaning the requested authority does not have the necessary information to assess the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings. The requested authority should also be able to refuse the request if the conduct is not a criminal offence at the place where it was committed and the requested State has no original jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute such offence. That ground for refusal takes into account the principle of territoriality, meaning that the requested State should be able to refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings in cases where the alleged criminal offence, which is committed outside the territory of the requesting State, is not a criminal offence at the place where it was committed, and the national law of the requested State does not authorise the prosecution of such offences where committed outside its territory. For the purposes of this Regulation, ‘original jurisdiction’ is the jurisdiction which is already provided for by national law and does not derive from this Regulation.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nThe principle of ne bis in idem, as set out in Articles 54 to 58 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 (28) and in Article 50 of the Charter, and as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, is a basic fundamental principle of criminal law, according to which a defendant should not be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for the criminal offence for which that defendant has already been finally acquitted or convicted. Therefore, the requested authority should refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings if taking them over would be contrary to that principle.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nWhen examining whether to accept or refuse a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings, the requested authority should assess whether such a transfer would serve the objective of efficient and proper administration of justice. That assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis in order to identify the Member State that is best placed to prosecute the criminal offence in question. The requested authority should enjoy a broad margin of discretion for the purpose of that assessment. Such assessment should be limited to the relevant circumstances of the case, including whether there is a prima facie indication that the criminal offence has not been committed either in whole or in part on the territory of the requested State, that most of the effects or a substantial part of the damage forming part of the constituent elements of the criminal offence did not occur on the territory of that State, and that the suspect or accused person is not a national of or a resident in that State. The personal, material or family situation of a victim, witness or other individual concerned should not be decisive in itself on the assessment of whether the transfer of criminal proceedings would serve the objective of efficient and proper administration of justice.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nBefore deciding to refuse a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings on the basis of any ground for refusal, the requested authority should, where appropriate, consult the requesting authority in order to obtain any necessary additional information.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nThe requested State should ensure access to an effective legal remedy for suspects, accused persons and victims, against the decision to accept the transfer of criminal proceedings, in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter and the procedures applicable under national law, whenever their rights are adversely affected by the application of this Regulation. Review of the decision concerning the transfer of criminal proceedings should be based exclusively on the criteria provided for in the grounds for refusal set out in this Regulation. The assessment of whether the criminal proceedings should be transferred should involve a consideration of all circumstances which are relevant for the examination of those criteria. That assessment might often involve not only balancing the interests or rights of individuals whose rights may be affected, but also a consideration of the specificities and practical aspects of the operation of the criminal justice system. Such legal remedy should be without prejudice to other legal remedies under national law.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nThe requested authority should have broad discretion in assessing whether the transfer of criminal proceedings is in the interests of efficient and proper administration of justice, and whether a request for transfer should be refused on any of the optional grounds for refusal set out in this Regulation. The examination of the exercise of such discretion should be limited to reviewing whether the requested authority, when taking the decision to accept the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings, has manifestly exceeded the limits of its discretion.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nThe outcome of the legal remedy could be that the decision to accept the transfer of criminal proceedings is upheld or overturned in whole or in part. In principle, in the case of a successful remedy, the criminal proceedings will revert to the requesting State. However, in some situations the court could also decide, in accordance with its national law, that the decision to accept the transfer of criminal proceedings can be upheld provided that certain conditions or additional formalities are complied with, for example the condition that some missing elements of the request form are completed, or that additional measures are taken for the execution of the transfer, such as continuing witness protection.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nA legal remedy under this Regulation should not entail any review of the merits of the case, such as whether the evidence is sufficient to justify opening or continuing an investigation, whether the facts of the case or the subjective aspects, such as intention or serious negligence, are established to the applicable standards, or concerning the probative value or the probative force of already collected evidence or the credibility of statements.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nWith a view to guaranteeing that the right to a legal remedy can be exercised effectively, the requested State should ensure that suspects, accused persons and victims have the right of access to all documents related to the transfer of criminal proceedings that formed the basis for the decision to accept a transfer under this Regulation, and that are necessary to effectively challenge that decision. The right of access to such documents should be exercised in accordance with procedures under the national law of the requested State and might be limited where it would undermine the confidentiality of an investigation, or otherwise prejudice the investigation or harm the safety of persons. Any refusal of such access should be weighed against the rights of the persons concerned, taking into account the different stages of the criminal proceedings. Restrictions on such access should be interpreted strictly and in accordance with the right to a fair trial under the Charter.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nThe time-limit for the suspect, accused person or victim to seek an effective legal remedy should not be longer than 15 days from the date of receipt by the person concerned of the reasoned decision to accept the transfer of criminal proceedings. Situations where the suspect, accused person or victim is not identified at the time of the transfer of criminal proceedings, and where for that reason the reasoned decision could not be communicated to such person at that time, should be subject to national law.\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nThe acceptance of the transfer of criminal proceedings by the requested authority should result in the suspension or discontinuation of criminal proceedings in the requesting State to avoid duplication of measures in the requesting State and requested State. That should however be without prejudice to necessary investigative or other procedural measures, including necessary urgent measures, which the requesting State might need to undertake after the receipt of notification of the acceptance by the requested authority, where the efficient and proper administration of justice so requires. The notion of ‘investigative or other procedural measures’ should be interpreted broadly as including not only any measure for the purpose of gathering evidence, but also any procedural act imposing pre-trial detention or any other interim measure. To ensure that the criminal proceedings are not prolonged at length in the requesting State, once the investigative or other procedural measures undertaken are finalised or no longer necessary, the criminal proceedings in the requesting State should be suspended or discontinued. If a legal remedy with a suspensive effect has been invoked in the requested State, the criminal proceedings should not be suspended or discontinued in the requesting State until a decision on the remedy has been taken in the requested State.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nIn cases where jurisdiction for the criminal proceedings is derived exclusively on the basis of this Regulation and where a request for transfer has been received and pending the decision on whether to accept or refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings, Member States should be able to provide under their national law a legal basis for the provisional arrest of the suspect or accused person staying in the requested State or for the adoption of other provisional measures by the competent authority of such State. Such provisional arrest or other provisional measures should only be taken in accordance with national law, and only where necessary. Such provisional arrest or other provisional measures should be subject to the same procedural safeguards applicable to the same measures under national law, including judicial oversight. Moreover, such provisional arrest or other provisional measures should be taken following a proper assessment on the basis of the information available to the requested authority. This Regulation should however not constitute a legal basis for arresting persons with a view to their physical transfer to the requested State in order for the latter to bring criminal proceedings against that person.\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nA competent authority of the requested State should inform the requesting authority in writing of any decision taken at the end of the criminal proceedings in the requested State. Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA imposes a similar obligation where an agreement was reached on the concentration of proceedings in one Member State. Where the requested authority decides to discontinue criminal proceedings related to the facts underlying the request for transfer, it should inform the requesting authority of the reasons for such discontinuation. At least the essential parts of such information and of the final written decision taken in the requested State should be translated by the requested authority into an official language of the requesting State or any other language accepted by that State in accordance with this Regulation. The essential parts of the information and the decision are meant to be those extracts that appear necessary for the requesting authority to have knowledge of their general content.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nIf the requested authority decides to discontinue criminal proceedings related to the facts underlying the request for transfer, the requesting authority should be able to continue or reopen criminal proceedings if that would not entail a violation of the ne bis in idem principle, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, namely where the decision to discontinue proceedings does not definitively bar further prosecution under the national law of the requested State and was not taken after a determination had been made on the merits of the case, therefore not precluding further criminal proceedings, in respect of the same acts, in that State. Victims should have the possibility to initiate or to request the reopening of criminal proceedings in the requesting State in accordance with the national law of that State, provided that this would not entail a violation of the ne bis in idem principle.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nOnce criminal proceedings are transferred in accordance with this Regulation, the requested authority should apply its relevant national law and procedures. Nothing in this Regulation should be interpreted as interfering with any prosecutorial discretion provided for in national law.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nNothing in this Regulation should be interpreted as affecting the duration of the period of limitation in the requested State, as provided for in the national law of that State.\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nWith the aim of giving full effect to the transfer of criminal proceedings, evidence transferred by the requesting authority should not be denied admission in the corresponding criminal proceedings in the requested State on the sole basis that such evidence was gathered in another Member State. The competent court in the requested State should maintain its judicial discretion in assessing such evidence in accordance with national law, while suspects and accused persons should maintain their rights to challenge the admissibility of such evidence in accordance with their rights of defence under the Charter. In line with those principles, and respecting the different legal systems and traditions of the Member States as provided for in Article 67(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), nothing in this Regulation is to be interpreted as prohibiting the courts from applying the fundamental principles of national law on fairness of the procedure that they apply in their national systems, including in common law systems.\n\n(60)\n\n\t\n\nThe requested State should apply its national law to determine the sentence applicable to the criminal offence in question. In cases where the criminal offence has been committed on the territory of the requesting State, the requested authorities should be able to take into consideration in the determination of the sentence the maximum sentence provided for in the national law of the requesting State, whenever this is to the benefit of the accused person, and in accordance with the national law of the requested State. This should be taken into account in situations where the transfer of criminal proceedings would lead to the application in the requested State of a higher sentence than the maximum sentence provided for in the requesting State for the same criminal offence, with a view to ensuring a degree of legal certainty and foreseeability of the applicable law for the suspects or accused persons concerned. The maximum sentence provided for in the national law of the requesting State should always be taken into account where jurisdiction of the requested State is based exclusively on this Regulation.\n\n(61)\n\n\t\n\nEach Member State should bear its own costs of transfers of criminal proceedings, including those related to the exercise of procedural rights to which the suspect or the accused person is entitled in each of the Member States concerned, in accordance with the applicable Union and national law. Member States should not be able to claim from each other compensation for costs resulting from the application of this Regulation. However, if the requesting State has incurred large or exceptional costs related to the translation of the documents in the case file to be transferred to the requested State, a proposal by the requesting authority to share the costs should be considered by the requested authority. In such cases, the requesting authority and requested authority should consult each other in order to reach an agreement on the sharing of costs. Ideally such consultations should take place before the request for transfer is issued. If no agreement can be reached before the decision to accept the transfer of criminal proceedings is adopted, the requesting authority should be able to decide to withdraw the request in accordance with this Regulation or to maintain the request and bear the part of the costs deemed to be exceptionally high.\n\n(62)\n\n\t\n\nThe use of a standardised request form translated in all official Union languages would facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information between the requesting authority and requested authority, allowing them to take a decision on the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings more quickly and effectively. The use of such a request form would also reduce translation costs and contribute to a higher quality of requests.\n\n(63)\n\n\t\n\nThe request form should only include personal data necessary to facilitate the requested authority’s decision on the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings. The request form should contain an indication of the categories of personal data, such as whether the person concerned is a suspect, accused person or victim, as well as the specific fields for each of those categories.\n\n(64)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to effectively address a possible need for improvement regarding the request form to be used to request the transfer of criminal proceedings or other forms, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annexes to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (29). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(65)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure swift, direct, interoperable, reliable and secure exchange of case-related data, communication under this Regulation between the requesting authority and requested authority and with the involvement of central authorities, where a Member State has designated a central authority, as well as with Eurojust, should as a rule be carried out through the decentralised IT system within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2023/2844 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30). In particular, the decentralised IT system should, as a rule, be used for the exchange of the request form, of any other relevant information and documents and of all other communication between the authorities under this Regulation. In cases where one or more of the exceptions provided for in Regulation (EU) 2023/2844 apply, in particular where the use of the decentralised IT system is not possible or appropriate, it should be possible to use other means of communication as specified in that Regulation.\n\n(66)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should be able to use software developed by the Commission (‘reference implementation software’) instead of a national IT system. The reference implementation software should be based on a modular setup, meaning that the software is packaged and delivered separately from the components of the e-CODEX system, established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/850 of the European Parliament and of the Council (31), which are needed to connect it to the decentralised IT system. That setup should enable Member States to reuse or enhance their existing national judicial communication infrastructure for the purpose of cross-border use.\n\n(67)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should be responsible for the creation, maintenance and development of the reference implementation software. The Commission should design, develop and maintain the reference implementation software in a way that allows the controllers to ensure compliance with the data protection requirements and principles laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (32) and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (33), in particular the obligations of data protection by design and by default as well as a high level of cybersecurity. The reference implementation software should also include appropriate technical measures and enable the organisational measures necessary for ensuring an appropriate level of security and interoperability, taking into account that special categories of data may also be exchanged. The Commission does not process personal data in the context of creation, maintenance and development of the reference implementation software.\n\n(68)\n\n\t\n\nThe reference implementation software developed by the Commission as a back-end system should programmatically collect the statistical data necessary for monitoring purposes and such data should be transmitted to the Commission. Where Member States choose to use a national IT system instead of the reference implementation software developed by the Commission, such a system could be equipped to collect those data programmatically and, in that case, those data should be transmitted to the Commission. The e-CODEX connector could also be equipped with a feature allowing retrieval of relevant statistical data.\n\n(69)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish a decentralised IT system. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34).\n\n(70)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should create the legal basis for the exchange of personal data between Member States for the purposes of the transfer of criminal proceedings in accordance with Article 8 and Article 10, point (a), of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, as regards any other aspects related to personal data, such as the period for the retention of personal data received by the requesting authority, the processing of personal data by the requesting authority and the requested authority should be subject to the national law of Member States adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/680. The requesting authority and the requested authority should be considered as controllers with respect to the processing of personal data under that Directive. The central authorities could provide administrative support to the requesting authority and requested authority and, to the extent they are processing personal data on behalf of those controllers, they should be considered as processors of the respective controller. As regards the processing of personal data by Eurojust, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 should apply in the context of this Regulation without prejudice to the specific data protection rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1727. Nothing in this Regulation should be interpreted as further extending access rights to other Union information systems under the Union legal acts establishing those systems.\n\n(71)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the transfer of criminal proceedings, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and its effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n(72)\n\n\t\n\nIn accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Ireland has notified, by letter of 13 July 2023, its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n\n(73)\n\n\t\n\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n\n(74)\n\n\t\n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on 22 May 2023 (35),\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter\n\n1.   This Regulation lays down rules on the transfer of criminal proceedings between the Member States with a view to improving the efficient and proper administration of justice within the common area of freedom, security and justice.\n\n2.   This Regulation applies in all cases of transfer of criminal proceedings conducted in Member States.\n\n3.   This Regulation shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect the fundamental rights and legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\n\nArticle 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\n‘requesting State’ means a Member State in which criminal proceedings are being conducted and in which a request for the transfer of those proceedings to another Member State is issued, or which has initiated or received a request for consultations concerning a possible transfer of criminal proceedings;\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\n‘requested State’ means a Member State to which a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings is transmitted for the purpose of taking over those proceedings, or which has received a request for or has initiated consultations concerning a possible transfer of criminal proceedings;\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\n‘requesting authority’ means:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na judge, court, investigating judge or public prosecutor in the requesting State competent in the case concerned; or\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nany other competent authority which is designated as such by the requesting State and which, in the case concerned, is acting in its capacity as an investigating authority in criminal proceedings with competence to request the transfer of criminal proceedings in accordance with national law. In addition, before the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings is transmitted to the requested authority, it shall be validated by a judge, court, investigating judge or public prosecutor in the requesting State after examining its conformity with the conditions for issuing such a request under this Regulation. Where the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings has been validated by a judge, court, investigating judge or public prosecutor in the requesting State, that authority may also be regarded as a requesting authority for the purposes of transmitting the request;\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\n‘requested authority’ means a judge, court, investigating judge or public prosecutor competent to take a decision on whether to accept or refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings in accordance with Article 11(1) and to take, where the legal system of the requested State so allows, subsequent measures in accordance with this Regulation or any measure as provided for in its national law.\n\nWithout prejudice to the requirement that a decision on whether to accept or refuse a transfer of criminal proceedings in accordance with Article 11(1) must be taken exclusively by a judge, court, investigating judge or public prosecutor, on the basis of its assessment of the grounds for refusal under Article 12, the requested State may, due to the structure of its internal legal system stemming from a common law legal tradition, where its national legal system does not allow for its courts or public prosecutors to take measures other than the decision on whether to accept or refuse the transfer of criminal proceedings in accordance with Article 11(1), provide that another authority, competent to take measures in criminal proceedings under its national law, take measures for the sole purpose of facilitating such judicial decision-making. Such other competent authority may also take subsequent measures for the purposes of this Regulation;\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\n‘decentralised IT system’ means a decentralised IT system as defined in Article 2, point (3), of Regulation (EU) 2023/2844;\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\n‘victim’ means a victim as defined in Article 2(1), point (a), of Directive 2012/29/EU, or a legal person, as defined by national law, that has suffered harm or economic loss as a direct result of a criminal offence that is the subject of criminal proceedings to which this Regulation applies.\n\nArticle 3\n\nJurisdiction\n\n1.   To the extent that jurisdiction is not already provided for by the national law of the requested State, for the purposes of this Regulation the requested State shall have jurisdiction over any criminal offence to which the national law of the requesting State is applicable in situations where:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe requested State refuses to surrender a suspect or accused person who is present in and is a national of or a resident in the requested State, on the basis of Article 4, point (7)(b), of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe requested State refuses to surrender a suspect or accused person for whom a European arrest warrant has been issued and who is present in and is a national of or a resident in the requested State, if, in exceptional situations, it finds that there are substantial grounds to believe, on the basis of specific and objective evidence, that the surrender would, in the particular circumstances of the case, entail a manifest breach of a relevant fundamental right as enshrined in Article 6 TEU and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’);\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nmost of the effects of the criminal offence or a substantial part of the damage forming part of the constituent elements of the criminal offence occurred on the territory of the requested State;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthere are ongoing criminal proceedings in the requested State against the suspect or accused person in respect of other facts and the suspect or accused person is a national of or a resident in the requested State; or\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthere are ongoing criminal proceedings in the requested State in respect of the same, partially the same or related facts against other persons and the suspect or accused person in the criminal proceedings to be transferred is a national of or a resident in the requested State.\n\n2.   Where jurisdiction is established by the requested State exclusively on the basis of paragraph 1, that jurisdiction shall only be exercised pursuant to a request for the transfer of criminal proceedings under this Regulation.\n\nArticle 4\n\nWaiver, suspension or discontinuation of criminal proceedings by the requesting State\n\nAny Member State having jurisdiction under its national law to prosecute a criminal offence may, for the purposes of applying this Regulation, waive, suspend or discontinue criminal proceedings in order to allow for the transfer of criminal proceedings in respect of that criminal offence to the requested State.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTRANSFER OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nArticle 5\n\nCriteria for requesting the transfer of criminal proceedings\n\n1.   A request for the transfer of criminal proceedings may be issued only where the requesting authority considers that the objective of efficient and proper administration of justice, including proportionality, would be better served by conducting the relevant criminal proceedings in another Member State.\n\n2.   The requesting authority shall take into account in particular the following criteria when considering whether to request the transfer of criminal proceedings:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe criminal offence has been committed in whole or in part on the territory of the requested State, or most of the effects of the criminal offence or a substantial part of the damage forming part of the constituent elements of the criminal offence occurred on the territory of the requested State;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\none or more suspects or accused persons are nationals of or residents in the requested State;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\none or more suspects or accused persons are present in the requested State and that State refuses to surrender those persons to the requesting State on the basis of:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nArticle 4, point (2), of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nArticle 4, point (3), of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA where such refusal is not based on a final judgment passed upon that person in respect of the same criminal offence which prevents further criminal proceedings; or\n\n(iii)\n\n\t\n\nArticle 4, point (7), of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\none or more suspects or accused persons for whom a European arrest warrant has been issued are present in the requested State and that State refuses to surrender those persons, if it finds that, in exceptional situations, there are substantial grounds to believe, on the basis of specific and objective evidence, that the surrender would, in the particular circumstances of the case, entail a manifest breach of a relevant fundamental right as enshrined in Article 6 TEU and the Charter;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nmost of the evidence relevant to the investigation is located in, or the majority of the relevant witnesses are residents in, the requested State;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nthere are ongoing criminal proceedings in the requested State in respect of the same, partially the same or other facts against the suspect or accused person;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nthere are ongoing criminal proceedings in the requested State in respect of the same, partially the same or related facts against other persons;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\none or more suspects or accused persons are serving or are to serve a sentence involving deprivation of liberty in the requested State;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nthe enforcement of the sentence in the requested State is likely to improve the prospects of social rehabilitation of the person sentenced or there are other reasons why enforcement of the sentence in the requested State would be more appropriate;\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\none or more victims are nationals of or residents in the requested State;\n\n(k)\n\n\t\n\nthe competent authorities of the Member States have reached consensus, under Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA or otherwise, on the concentration of the criminal proceedings in one Member State.\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (j), the requesting authority shall take due account of child victims and other vulnerable persons.\n\n3.   A suspect, accused person or victim may, in accordance with procedures under national law, propose to the competent authorities of the requesting State or of the requested State that criminal proceedings be transferred in accordance with this Regulation.

The requesting authority and the requested authority shall also cooperate on provisional measures taken before transfer and under paragraph 2.\n\n4.   Where the execution of the measures taken under paragraph 2 has been finalised, or where the requested authority has taken the necessary investigative or other procedural measures, and the measures undertaken by the requesting authority under paragraph 2 are no longer necessary, the criminal proceedings in the requesting state shall be suspended or discontinued.\n\n5.   The requesting authority may continue or reopen criminal proceedings if the requested authority informs it of its decision to discontinue criminal proceedings related to the facts underlying the criminal proceedings for which the transfer was accepted, unless that decision, under the national law of the requested State, definitively bars further prosecution and was taken after a determination had been made on the merits of the case, therefore precluding further criminal proceedings, in respect of the same acts, in the requested State.\n\n6.   Paragraph 5 shall not affect the right of victims to initiate or to request the reopening of criminal proceedings against the suspect or accused person in the requesting State, where the national law of that State so provides, unless the decision by the requested authority to discontinue criminal proceedings, under the national law of the requested State, definitively bars further prosecution and was taken after a determination had been made on the merits of the case, therefore precluding further criminal proceedings, in respect of the same acts, in the requested State.\n\nArticle 22\n\nEffects in the requested State\n\n1.   The transferred criminal proceedings shall be governed by the national law of the requested State.\n\n2.   Provided that it is not contrary to the fundamental principles of law of the requested State, any act carried out for the purposes of the criminal proceedings or preparatory inquiries performed by competent authorities in the requesting State shall have the same validity in the requested State as if it had been validly performed by competent authorities in the requested State.\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 12(1), point (d), any act validly performed in the requesting State that interrupts or suspends the period of limitation shall have the same effect of interruption or suspension of the period of limitation in the requested State provided that such act would have that effect under its national law.\n\n3.   Member States may provide in their national law that, in cases where jurisdiction is based on Article 3, and where they act as requested State and the suspect or accused person is present in that State, a competent authority in the requested State may, once it has received the request for the transfer of criminal proceedings and any additional information in accordance with this Regulation, and before the decision to accept the transfer is made, take, upon assessment, the necessary measures, in accordance with its national law, to arrest the suspect or accused person, or to ensure that the suspect or accused person remains on its territory, or take other necessary provisional measures such as freezing measures.\n\n4.   The decision to place the suspect or accused person in detention in accordance with paragraph 3 shall be taken by the same authority that would be competent to take such measures in a similar domestic case, and shall be subject to safeguards applicable to such measures under national law, including judicial oversight and the time-limits for pre-trial detention.\n\n5.   Evidence transferred by the requesting authority shall not be denied admission in criminal proceedings in the requested State only on the ground that the evidence was gathered in another Member State. The evidence gathered in the requesting State may be used in criminal proceedings in the requested State, provided that the admissibility of such evidence is in accordance with the national law of the requested State, including its fundamental principles of law. The power of the trial court to freely assess the evidence shall not be affected by this Regulation.\n\n6.   Where a custodial sentence or detention order is issued in the requested State, that State shall deduct from the total period of detention to be served all periods of detention spent in the requesting State that were imposed in the context of the transferred criminal proceedings. To that end, the requesting authority shall transmit to the requested authority all information concerning the period of detention spent by the suspect or accused person in the requesting State.\n\n7.   Where in both the requesting State and the requested State, criminal proceedings can only be initiated following a complaint, a complaint brought in the requesting State shall also have validity in the requested State.\n\n8.   The sentence applicable to the criminal offence shall be that provided for in the national law of the requested State unless that law provides otherwise.

Where jurisdiction is exclusively based on Article 3, the sentence imposed in the requested State shall not be more severe than the maximum sentence under the national law of the requesting State.\n\nArticle 23\n\nInformation to be provided by the requested authority\n\nThe requested authority or, where applicable, another competent authority shall provide the requesting authority with information on the discontinuation of criminal proceedings or on any decision taken at the end of the criminal proceedings, including information as to whether that decision, under the national law of the requested State, definitively bars further prosecution and was taken after a determination had been made on the merits of the case thereby precluding further criminal proceedings, in respect of the same acts, in that State. That authority shall also provide information on the final execution of the sentence imposed or other information of substantial value. It shall forward a copy of the final written decision taken at the end of the criminal proceedings to the requesting authority.\n\nAt least the essential parts of the information and of the final decision referred to in the first paragraph of this Article shall be translated into an official language of the requesting State or any other language accepted by the requesting State in accordance with Article 32(1), point (d).\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nMEANS OF COMMUNICATION\n\nArticle 24\n\nMeans of communication\n\n1.   Communication under this Regulation, including the exchange of the request form and other forms set out in the Annexes to this Regulation, the decision referred to in Article 11(1) of this Regulation and other documents referred to in Article 11(5) thereof, between the requesting authority and requested authority and with the involvement of central authorities, where a Member State has designated a central authority in accordance with Article 20 of this Regulation, as well as with Eurojust, shall be carried out in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2844.\n\n2.   Article 7(1) and (2) and Articles 8 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2844 setting out rules on electronic signatures and electronic seals, legal effects of electronic documents and the protection of information transmitted shall apply to the communication transmitted through the decentralised IT system.\n\n3.   Consultations under Article 11(7) and Article 14 between the requesting authority and the requested authority and with the involvement of central authorities, where a Member State has designated a central authority in accordance with Article 20, as well as with Eurojust, may be carried out using any appropriate means of communication, including through the decentralised IT system.\n\nArticle 25\n\nEstablishment of a decentralised IT system\n\n1.   By 8 January 2027, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish the decentralised IT system for the purposes of this Regulation, setting out the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe technical specifications for the methods of communication by electronic means for the purposes of the decentralised IT system;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe technical specifications for communication protocols;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe information security objectives and relevant technical measures ensuring minimum information security standards and a high level of cybersecurity for the processing and communication of information within the decentralised IT system;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe minimum availability objectives and possible related technical requirements for the services provided by the decentralised IT system;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\ndigital procedural standards as defined in Article 3, point (9), of Regulation (EU) 2022/850.\n\n2.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 31(2).\n\nArticle 26\n\nReference implementation software\n\n1.   The Commission shall be responsible for the creation, accessibility, maintenance and development of reference implementation software which Member States may choose to apply as their back-end system instead of a national IT system.

    "texte": "REGULATION (EU) 2024/3015 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\nof 27 November 2024\n\non prohibiting products made with forced labour on the Union market and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article 207 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nAs recognised in the Preamble to the 2014 Protocol to Convention No 29 on forced labour (ILO Convention No 29) of the International Labour Organization (ILO), forced labour constitutes a serious violation of human dignity and fundamental human rights, contributes to the perpetuation of poverty and stands in the way of the achievement of decent work for all. The ILO declared the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour as a principle of fundamental rights. The ILO classifies ILO Convention No 29, including the supplementing 2014 Protocol to Convention No 29 and the ILO Convention No 105 on the abolition of forced labour (ILO Convention No 105) as fundamental ILO conventions and issues recommendations to prevent, eliminate, and remedy forced labour, such as the Forced Labour (Supplementary Measures) Recommendation No 203. The ILO has developed several indicators used to identify and indicate cases of forced labour, such as threats and actual physical and sexual harm, abuse of vulnerability, abuse of working and living conditions and excessive overtime, deception, restriction of movement or confinement to the workplace or a limited area, isolation, debt bondages, withholding wages or excessive wage reduction, retention of passports and identity documents or threat of denunciation to the authorities when the worker has an irregular immigration status. Forced labour is very often linked to poverty and discrimination. The manipulation of credit and debt, either by employers or by recruiting agents, is still a key factor that traps vulnerable workers in forced labour situations. According to the ILO supervisory bodies, prison labour, including where it is performed for private companies, does not in itself constitute forced labour, provided that it is done on a voluntary basis, for the benefit of the prisoner and is comparable to the conditions of a free labour relationship. Community work as an alternative penal sanction to imprisonment should always be in the public interest and should, under no circumstances, be abused by states as a means to degrade the convicted person or deprive that person of their dignity. In cases in which work or service is imposed by exploiting the worker’s vulnerability under the threat of a penalty, that threat does not need to take the form of a penal sanction but might take the form of a loss of rights or benefits.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThe use of forced labour is widespread in the world. It is estimated that about 27,6 million people were in situations of forced labour in 2021. Vulnerable and marginalised groups in society are particularly susceptible to being pressured into performing forced labour. Such groups include women, children, ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, lower casters, indigenous and tribal people, and migrants, especially undocumented migrants, who have a precarious status and operate in the informal economy. Even when it is not state imposed, forced labour is often a consequence of the absence or lack of good governance with regard to certain economic operators and a demonstration of a state’s failure to enforce social and labour rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalised groups. Forced labour can also take place as a result of authorities’ tacit consent. 86 % of all forced labour cases occur in the private sector, in particular through the forced labour exploitation of 17,3 million people. The obligations of economic operators set out in this Regulation should be predictable and clear in order to ensure full and effective compliance and contribute to bringing forced labour to an end.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nThe eradication of forced labour in all its forms, including state imposed forced labour, is a priority for the Union. Respect for human dignity and the universality and indivisibility of human rights are firmly enshrined in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In order to achieve Target 8.7 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, the Union should uphold and promote its values and contribute to the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child. Article 5 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) explicitly prohibits slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and trafficking in human beings, and Article 4 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides that no one is to be required to perform forced or compulsory labour. The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly interpreted Article 4 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as requiring Member States to penalise and effectively prosecute any act maintaining a person in the situations set out in that Article. The right to effective remedies for violations of fundamental rights is a human right, and a fundamental element in the process of effective prosecution of crimes. Existing Union law, the United Nations Guiding Principles on the Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the Council of Europe recommendation on human rights and business and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, such as the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct, affirm that victims have the right to an effective remedy for business-related human rights violations or abuses, including forced labour.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nAll Member States have ratified the fundamental ILO conventions in the area of forced labour, namely ILO Convention No 29 and ILO Convention No 105, and ILO Convention No 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour (ILO Convention No 182). They are therefore legally obliged to prevent and eliminate the use of forced labour and to report regularly to the ILO.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nThrough its policies and legislative initiatives, the Union seeks to eradicate the use of forced labour and promote decent work and labour rights worldwide. The Union promotes due diligence in line with international guidelines and principles established by international organisations, including the ILO, the OECD and the United Nations, to ensure that forced labour does not have a place in the supply chains of undertakings established in the Union.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nUnion trade policy supports the fight against forced labour in both unilateral and bilateral trade relationships. The trade and sustainable development chapters of Union trade agreements contain a commitment to ratify and effectively implement the fundamental ILO conventions, which include ILO Convention No 29 and ILO Convention No 105, whereas trade and gender provisions establish a gender lens that is essential for the economic empowerment of women in order to combat gendered forced labour. Moreover, unilateral tariff preferences under the Union’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences may be withdrawn for serious and systematic violations of ILO Convention No 29 and ILO Convention No 105.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nForced labour has a distinct impact on vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as children, women, migrants, refugees or indigenous peoples, and therefore an intersectional and gender-sensitive approach is essential to combat forced labour effectively. This Regulation is therefore expected to contribute to the objectives of relevant international agreements and conventions, such as ILO Convention No 182, the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, the Beijing Declaration of September 1995, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and ILO Convention No 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nDirective 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) harmonises the definition of trafficking in human beings, including forced labour or services, and establishes rules on minimum penalties. Any rules laid down concerning the prohibition of placing and making available on the Union market domestic or imported products made with forced labour, or exporting such products, and the obligation to ensure that such products are withdrawn from the Union market (prohibition of products made with forced labour), should be without prejudice to that Directive, and in particular to the competence of law enforcement and judicial authorities to investigate and prosecute offences related to trafficking in human beings, including labour exploitation.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) requires Union importers of minerals or metals falling under the scope of that Regulation to carry out due diligence obligations consistent with Annex II to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, and the due diligence recommendations set out therein. Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) contains obligations for economic operators to carry out due diligence in their supply chains, including with respect to labour rights. Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) requires due diligence regarding certain commodities and products associated with deforestation and forest degradation, including with respect to human rights.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nDirective 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) requires Member States to ensure that certain economic operators annually publish non-financial statements in which they report on the impact of their activity on environmental, social and employee matters and on respect for human rights, including on forced labour, anti-corruption and bribery matters. Furthermore, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) on corporate sustainability reporting amended that requirement by introducing detailed reporting requirements for companies falling within the scope of that Directive regarding respect for human rights, including in global supply chains. The information that undertakings disclose about human rights should include, where relevant, information about forced labour in their value chains.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nAs a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Union is committed to promoting a rules-based, open, multilateral trading system. Any measures introduced by the Union that affect trade should be WTO compliant.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nIn July 2021, the Commission and the European External Action Service published guidance on due diligence for EU businesses to address the risk of forced labour in their operations and supply chains.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nAs recognised in the communication of the Commission of 23 February 2022 on decent work worldwide for a global just transition and a sustainable recovery, notwithstanding the current policies and legislative framework, further action is needed to achieve the objectives of eliminating forced-labour products from the Union market and, hence, further contributing to the fight against forced labour worldwide.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nCore priorities of the Union, as enshrined in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020–2024, include promoting decent work and a human-centred future of work ensuring respect for fundamental principles and human rights, promoting social dialogue, as well as the ratification and effective implementation of relevant ILO conventions and protocols, strengthening responsible management in global supply chains and access to social protection.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nIn its resolutions of 9 June 2022 on a new trade instrument to ban products made by forced labour (9), of 17 December 2020 on forced labour and the situation of the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (10) and of 16 December 2021 on forced labour in the Linglong factory and environmental protests in Serbia (11), the European Parliament strongly condemned forced labour and called for a ban on products made with forced labour. It is therefore a matter of public moral concern that products made with forced labour could be available on the Union market or exported to third countries without an effective mechanism to ban or withdraw such products.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nTo complete the Union legislative and policy framework on forced labour, the placing and making available on the Union market of products made with forced labour or exporting domestically produced or imported products made with forced labour should be prohibited and it should be ensured that those products are withdrawn from the Union market.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nCurrently there is no Union law that empowers Member States’ authorities to directly detain, seize, or order the withdrawal of a product on the basis of a finding that it was made, whether in whole or in part, with forced labour.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the effectiveness of this Regulation, the prohibition of products made with forced labour should apply to products for which forced labour has been used at any stage of the production, manufacture, harvest or extraction of those products, including in the working or processing related to such products. The prohibition of products made with forced labour should apply to all products, of any type, including their components, and should apply to products regardless of the sector, the origin, whether they are domestic or imported, or placed or made available on the Union market or exported. This Regulation does not apply to the provision of transport services.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nThe prohibition of products made with forced labour should contribute to the international efforts to abolish forced labour. The definition of ‘forced labour’ should therefore be aligned with the definition laid down in ILO Convention No 29 stating that forced or compulsory labour means all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily, with the exclusion of any work or service exacted in virtue of compulsory military service laws for work of a purely military character; any work or service which forms part of the normal civic obligations of the citizens of a fully self-governing country; any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a court of law, provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a public authority and that the said person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations; any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of war or of a calamity or threatened calamity, such as fire, flood, famine, earthquake, violent epidemic or epizootic diseases, invasion by animal, insect or vegetable pests, and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population; and minor communal services of a kind which, being performed by the members of the community in the direct interest of the said community, can therefore be considered to be normal civic obligations incumbent upon the members of the community, provided that the members of the community or their direct representatives shall have the right to be consulted in regard to the need for such services.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nBased on the definition of forced labour specified in ILO Convention No 29 and used in this Regulation, the ILO indicators of forced labour and the ILO guidelines entitled ‘Hard to See, Harder to Count’ set out the most common signs that point to the possible existence of forced labour and should be taken into account when implementing this Regulation. However, those indicators may be insufficient for the identification of forced labour imposed by state authorities, which is based on systemic and global coercive policies that require additional, specifically designed indicators.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nThe definition of ‘forced labour imposed by state authorities’ should be aligned with ILO Convention No 105, which specifically prohibits the use of forced labour or compulsory labour as a means of political coercion or education or as punishment for the expression of political views or views ideologically opposed to the established political, social or economic system. It also prohibits the use of forced labour as a method of mobilising and using it for the purposes of economic development, as a means of labour discipline, as a punishment for having participated in strikes, or as a means of racial, social, national or religious discrimination.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nDistance sales, including online selling, should also fall within the scope of this Regulation. In the case of a product offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales, the product should be considered to be made available on the market if the offer for sale is targeted at end users in the Union. In line with the applicable Union law on private international law, a case-by-case analysis should be carried out in order to establish whether an offer is targeted at end users in the Union. An offer for sale should be considered to be targeted at end users in the Union if the relevant economic operator directs, by any means, its activities to a Member State. For the case-by-case analyses, relevant factors, such as the geographical areas to which dispatch is possible, the languages available and used for the offer or for ordering, means of payment, the use of currency of the Member State or a domain name registered in one of the Member States should be taken into consideration in this regard. In the case of online sales, the mere fact that the interface of economic operators or the interface of providers of online marketplaces is accessible in the Member State in which the end users is established or domiciled is insufficient. The fact that products offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales are deemed to be made available on the Union market if the offer for sale is targeted at end users in the Union empowers competent authorities to check and take the necessary actions in relation to such products pursuant to this Regulation, even though they are not yet actually placed on the Union market at the moment of the offer for sale online or through other means of distance sales. Such products are to comply with the relevant Union law in force at the moment when they are actually placed on the Union market and, in the case of products entering the Union, when they are placed under the customs procedure ‘release for free circulation’. The fact that the product, offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales, is deemed to be made available on the market if the offer for sale is targeted at end users in the Union should be without prejudice to rules regarding products entering or leaving the Union market.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nThere has been an increase in the use of intermediary services, in particular online marketplaces, for the sale of products. In this regard, any information related to the sale of products contravening the prohibition of products made with forced labour established in this Regulation should be considered to be illegal content within the meaning of Article 3, point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and should be subject to the obligations and measures set out in that Regulation.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States should identify violations of the prohibition of products made with forced labour. In designating the competent authorities, Member States should ensure that those authorities have sufficient human and financial resources and that their staff have the necessary competences and knowledge, especially with regard to human rights, labour rights, gender equality, supply chain management and due diligence processes. Competent authorities should coordinate closely with national labour inspection authorities and judicial and law enforcement authorities, including those responsible for the fight against trafficking in human beings in such a way as to avoid jeopardising investigations by such authorities.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the effective implementation of its tasks under this Regulation, in particular with regard to carrying out investigations, the Commission should be able to request the assistance of other Union bodies, offices or agencies with an appropriate mandate. Those tasks could include: processing submissions of information, supporting the allocation of investigations, conducting the preliminary investigations and investigations, facilitating cooperation with and among authorities of Member States, facilitating international cooperation, supporting the development of support tools and, if appropriate, supporting implementation by customs authorities and supporting the Commission in preparing decisions to ban products made with forced labour. This is without prejudice to the Commission’s task, in its role as a lead competent authority, to take decisions to prohibit the placing on the market of products made with forced labour. The Commission, in its role as a lead competent authority, should exercise its powers impartially, transparently and with due respect for obligations of professional secrecy and should have the necessary expertise. The Commission should have the means to finance the necessary staff and related costs to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under this Regulation and build the required expertise.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nCompetent authorities and the Commission should be guided by the principle of proportionality when implementing this Regulation. Competent authorities and the Commission should ensure, in particular, that all the measures and actions carried out during the preliminary phase of the investigation and during the investigation and those set out in the decision are suitable and necessary to achieve the desired purpose and do not impose an excessive burden on economic operators.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure cooperation between the Commission and competent authorities designated under this Regulation and authorities designated under other relevant Union and national law and in order to ensure consistency in their actions and decisions, the Commission and competent authorities designated under this Regulation should request information from other relevant authorities, where necessary, regarding whether economic operators under assessment are subject to and carry out due diligence in relation to forced labour in accordance with applicable Union or national law setting out due diligence and transparency requirements with respect to forced labour. When requesting information from economic operators, competent authorities should, where possible, follow the Commission’s once-only principle, through increased cooperation and dialogue between authorities who are engaged in overseeing product regulation. For the same purposes, and where appropriate, competent authorities designated under this Regulation should inform other relevant authorities, such as market surveillance authorities, of their actions and decisions.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nThe uniform enforcement of the prohibition of products made with forced labour entering or leaving the Union market can only be achieved through a systematic exchange of information and cooperation amongst competent authorities, customs authorities and the Commission. Such information exchange and cooperation should be supported by the Commission.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nFor the collection, processing and storage of information, in a structured form, on issues relating to the investigations, decision-making process, and enforcement of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, the competent authorities should use the information and communication system for market surveillance referred to in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), in accordance with the implementing act that the Commission should be empowered to adopt under this Regulation (the ‘ICSMS’). The Commission, competent authorities and customs authorities should have access to that system to carry out their respective duties under this Regulation. It is also possible for competent authorities to use other existing communication systems to communicate with other authorities within their own Member State, as long as it does not affect the obligation of using the ICSMS for the purposes of implementing this Regulation.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to optimise and unburden the control process of products entering or leaving the Union market, it is necessary to allow for automated data transfer between the ICSMS and customs systems. Three different data transfers should be distinguished in view of their respective purposes. Firstly, decisions establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour should be communicated from the ICSMS to the electronic Customs Risk Management System referred to in Article 36 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 (14), without prejudice to any future evolution of the customs risk management environment, for use by customs authorities to identify products that may correspond to such a decision. The available interfaces of the customs environment should be used for those first data transfers. Secondly, where customs authorities identify such a product, case management will be necessary to, inter alia, transfer the notification of the suspension, the conclusion of competent authorities and the outcome of the actions taken by customs authorities. The EU Single Window Environment for Customs should support those second data transfers between the ICSMS and national customs systems. Thirdly, customs systems contain information on products entering and leaving the Union market that would be relevant for competent authorities to carry out their duties but that is not accessible to them. The relevant information should therefore be extracted and transmitted to the ICSMS. The three interconnections should be highly automated and easy-to-use, so as to limit any additional burden for customs authorities. The Commission should be empowered to adopt, in cooperation with customs authorities and competent authorities, the implementing acts necessary to determine the procedural rules, practical arrangements and data elements to be transferred between the ICSMS and customs systems and any other ancillary requirement.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should establish an indicative and non-exhaustive database of forced labour risks to support the work of competent authorities in assessing potential violations of the prohibition of products made with forced labour and help economic operators identify possible forced labour risks in their supply chains. The Commission should be able to resort to external expertise to develop the database. The database should identify forced labour risks in specific geographic areas or with respect to specific products or product groups, with a particular focus on widespread and severe forced labour risks, based on reliable and verifiable information from international institutions, such as the ILO and the UN, and research or academic institutions. That database should be made publicly available through the Forced Labour Single Portal. Where there is reliable and verifiable evidence that products produced by specific economic sectors in specific geographic areas present a high risk of having been made with forced labour imposed by state authorities, those sectors in those areas should be identified in the database established pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nMicro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can have limited resources and ability to ensure that the products they place or make available on the Union market are free from forced labour. The Commission should therefore issue guidelines on due diligence in relation to forced labour, which should also take into account the size and economic resources of economic operators. In addition, the Commission should issue guidelines on forced-labour risk indicators, including how to identify them, which should be based on independent and verifiable information, including reports from international organisations, in particular the ILO.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should prevent an unnecessary administrative burden for SMEs. In addition, the Commission should develop accompanying measures to support the efforts of economic operators and their business partners in the same supply chain, in particular SMEs. Member States should designate contact points for SMEs for the purposes of this Regulation which can be existing business and human rights helpdesks or due diligence contact points. SMEs should be able to contact the competent authority of the Member State in which they are established, using the information provided in the Forced Labour Single Portal. They should, in particular, be able to liaise with a competent authority to support them throughout the course of an investigation. Sufficient support resources should also be made available online in a clear and understandable way for SMEs.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should issue guidelines on how to engage in dialogue with competent authorities in order to help economic operators, and in particular SMEs, as well as other stakeholders, to comply with the prohibition of products made with forced labour. Furthermore, the Commission should also issue guidelines to assist any person or association in submitting information.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nTaking into account the variety of Union law dealing with forced labour issues, the Commission should provide guidance for economic operators, in particular SMEs, on how to apply the different obligations stemming from Union law.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should issue guidelines in order to facilitate the implementation of this Regulation by economic operators and competent authorities. Guidelines for economic operators should include guidance on due diligence in relation to forced labour, including for different types of suppliers and sectors of activity, on best practices for bringing to an end and remediating forced labour and on responsible disengagement. Remediation is understood to be the restitution of the affected person or persons or communities to a situation equivalent or as close as possible to the situation they would be in had forced labour not occurred, proportionate to the company’s involvement in the forced labour, including financial or non-financial compensation provided by the company to a person or persons affected by forced labour and, where applicable, reimbursement of the costs incurred by public authorities for any necessary remedial measures. Guidance for competent authorities should focus on information relevant for the practical implementation of this Regulation. The guidance on due diligence in relation to forced labour should build on the Guidance on due diligence for Union businesses to address the risk of forced labour in their operations and supply chains published by the Commission and the European External Action Service in July 2021. The guidelines should be consistent with other Commission guidelines in this regard and relevant international organisations’ guidelines. The guidelines should be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and rely on experience and best practices from relevant Member State authorities. The reports from international organisations, in particular the ILO, as well as other independent and verifiable sources of information, should be considered for the identification of risk indicators.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nSince forced labour is a global problem and given the interlinkages of global supply chains, it is necessary to promote international cooperation against forced labour, which would also improve the efficiency of implementing this Regulation. The Commission should, as appropriate, cooperate and exchange information with authorities of third countries, international organisations and other relevant stakeholders to enhance the effective implementation of this Regulation. International cooperation with authorities of third countries, including with countries with similar legislation in place, should take place in a structured way as part of the existing dialogue structures with those countries, or, if necessary, specific dialogue structures that will be created on an ad hoc basis. This cooperation should be able to include exchanges of information on forced labour risks, such as those identified in the database, and on decisions to ban products, but should not include information on ongoing investigations. Union delegations can contribute to disseminating information about this Regulation and to facilitate the submission of information on forced labour risks by relevant stakeholders. International cooperation may also include the development of cooperation initiatives and accompanying measures to support relevant stakeholders in their efforts to eliminate forced labour from global supply chains, as well as the creation of enabling environments in third countries to promote and protect human rights.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nAny natural or legal person, or any association not having legal personality, should be allowed to submit information to the competent authorities when it considers that products made with forced labour are placed and made available on the Union market and should be informed of the outcome of the assessment of their submission of information. Submissions of information on alleged violations should be made via a single information submission point set up by the Commission and made available on the Forced Labour Single Portal. In order to ensure the ease of use of the submissions of information and the standardisation of the information provided, the Commission should issue guidance on the use of the single information submission point and should be able to adopt implementing acts to specify the procedural rules, templates and details of the submissions of information. Submissions of information that are manifestly incomplete, unfounded or made in bad faith should be discarded. Adequate measures should be put in place to ensure the protection of any person associated with the submission or the information contained therein including from retaliation.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nWhistleblowers can bring new information to the attention of competent authorities to help them to detect breaches of this Regulation and enable them to take action. In order to ensure that adequate arrangements are in place to enable whistleblowers to alert the competent authorities to actual or potential breaches of this Regulation and to protect the whistleblowers from retaliation, this Regulation should provide that Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) is applicable to the reporting of breaches of this Regulation and to the protection of persons reporting such breaches, insofar as they fall within the personal scope of that Directive.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nTo enhance legal certainty, the applicability, pursuant to this Regulation, of Directive (EU) 2019/1937 regarding reports of breaches of this Regulation and the protection of persons reporting such breaches should be reflected in that Directive. The Annex to Directive (EU) 2019/1937 should therefore be amended accordingly. It is for the Member States to ensure that, from the date of application of this Regulation, that amendment is reflected in the transposition measures adopted in accordance with that Directive. However, the adoption of national transposition measures is not a condition for the applicability of that Directive regarding the reporting of breaches of this Regulation or the protection of reporting persons.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure ease of access to relevant information regarding this Regulation, the Commission should set up a single web portal at Union level, available to the public in all official languages of the institutions of the Union.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nWhen identifying potential violations of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, the Commission or the competent authorities should follow a risk-based approach and assess all of the information available to them. In order to implement the risk-based approach in the prioritisation of their investigations, the Commission and competent authorities should take into account the share of the part of the product suspected to have been made with forced labour in the final product, the quantity and volume of products concerned, and the scale and severity of the suspected forced labour, including whether forced labour imposed by state authorities could be a concern. The Commission and competent authorities should also take into account the size and economic resources of the economic operators and the complexity of the supply chain, and focus to the extent possible on the economic operators and where relevant product suppliers that are closer to the risk of forced labour and have the highest leverage to prevent, mitigate and bring to an end the use of forced labour.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nBefore initiating an investigation, the lead competent authority should be able to request information from economic operators under assessment and also from other relevant stakeholders, including the persons or associations that have submitted relevant information to competent authorities. The lead competent authority should be able to choose not to request additional information from economic operators if it assesses that this could lead to an attempt by those economic operators to hide a situation of forced labour and thus jeopardise the investigation. The lead competent authority should initiate an investigation where, based on its assessment of all available information or on the basis of any other facts available where it was not possible to gather information and evidence during the preliminary phase of the investigation, it establishes that there is a substantiated concern that there has been a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to increase the effectiveness of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, competent authorities should grant reasonable time to economic operators to identify, mitigate, prevent and bring to an end the risk of forced labour, taking into account, inter alia, the complexity of the process and the number of stakeholders involved.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nBefore initiating an investigation, the lead competent authority should request the economic operators under assessment to provide information on actions taken to mitigate, prevent, bring to an end risks of forced labour or remediate forced labour cases in their operations and supply chains with respect to the products under assessment. Carrying out due diligence in relation to forced labour should contribute to helping the economic operator to be at a lower risk of having forced labour in its operations and supply chains. Appropriate due diligence in accordance with relevant Union law and international standards can help to identify and address forced labour in the supply chain. That implies that no investigation should be initiated where the lead competent authority considers that there is no substantiated concern of a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, or that the reasons for a substantiated concern have been eliminated, for instance due to, but not limited to, the applicable legislation, guidelines, recommendations or any other due diligence in relation to forced labour being applied in a way that mitigates, prevents and brings to an end the risk of forced labour.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nThe lead competent authority, when requesting information during the investigation, should prioritise to the extent possible and consistent with the effective conduct of the investigation, the economic operators under investigation that are involved in the steps of the supply chain as close as possible to where the risk of forced labour is likely to occur and take into account the size and economic resources of the economic operators and quantity of products concerned, as well as the scale of suspected forced labour.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nThe lead competent authorities should bear the burden of establishing whether forced labour has been used at any stage of the production, manufacture, harvest or extraction of a product placed or made available on the market or for export, including in the working or processing related to the product, on the basis of all information and evidence gathered during the investigation, including its preliminary phase. To ensure their right to due process, economic operators should have the opportunity to provide information in their defence to the competent authorities during the investigation. Where, in response to a request for information from a lead competent authority, an economic operator or a public authority refuses or fails, without a valid justification, to provide the information requested, provides incomplete or incorrect information with the objective of blocking the investigation, provides misleading information or otherwise impedes the investigation, including when a risk of forced labour imposed by state authorities is identified, the lead competent authority should be able to establish that the prohibition of products made with forced labour has been violated on the basis of any other relevant and verifiable information gathered during the preliminary phase of the investigation or during the investigation. The lead competent authority should also take those factors into account when reviewing a decision taken on that basis.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nWhere the lead competent authority establishes that economic operators have violated the prohibition of products made with forced labour, it should without delay prohibit the placing and making available of such products on the Union market and their export from the Union, and require the economic operators that have been investigated to withdraw the products concerned already made available from the Union market and donate perishable products to charitable or public interest causes. In the case of non-perishable products, economic operators should recycle such products, and if that is not possible, they should have the product destroyed, rendered inoperable, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with national law in compliance with Union law, including Union law on waste management. Nevertheless, particular attention should be paid to preventing disruptions to supply chains of strategic or critical importance for the Union and, in this regard, to products, the disposal of which would alter the proper functioning of the internal market and of such supply chains. In those cases, by way of derogation from the obligation to impose an order to have the product concerned disposed of, the lead competent authority should, where appropriate, be able to order the product concerned to be withheld for a defined period, at the cost of the economic operators. When assessing the strategic or critical importance of a product for the Union, the lead competent authority should, in particular, take into account the list of sectors established in the Regulation (EU) 2024/1735 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) and the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/2113 (17) as well as the products listed in the Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18). When assessing whether a derogation from the obligation to impose an order of disposal is appropriate, the lead competent authority should bear in mind the likelihood of the economic operators concerned complying with the conditions for the review of the decision establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour within the period defined by the lead competent authority. The period set by the lead competent authority would allow the economic operators concerned to demonstrate that they have eliminated forced labour with regard to the product concerned, by having brought it to an end within their supply chain. Changing a supply chain, in the sense of relying on different suppliers, cannot be considered as a method of eliminating forced labour regarding the product concerned by that decision, since it would result in a different product. If the economic operators concerned provide the evidence demonstrating that they have eliminated forced labour with regard to the product concerned, the lead competent authority should review its decision prohibiting the placing and making available of such products on the Union market, leading to its withdrawal, and therefore lift the withholding of the products concerned. If the economic operators concerned do not provide such evidence, they should comply with the order to dispose of the products concerned after the expiry of the period included in the decision prohibiting the placing and making available of such products on the Union market, which contains the order to withhold the products for a defined period.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nIn a decision establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, the lead competent authority should state the findings of the investigation, and the information underpinning the findings, and set a reasonable time limit within which the economic operators should comply with that decision, as well as information identifying the product to which the decision applies. The Commission should be empowered to adopt the implementing acts necessary to specify the details of the information to be contained in such decisions. The decisions of the lead competent authority should be made publicly available.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nIn setting a reasonable time limit within which to comply with orders set out in a decision establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, the lead competent authority should take into account the size and economic resources of the economic operators concerned.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure effective enforcement, decisions taken by a lead competent authority in one Member State should be recognised and enforced by competent authorities in the other Member States regarding products with the same identification information from the same supply chain for which forced labour has been found.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nEconomic operators should be able to request a review of the decisions of lead competent authorities pursuant to this Regulation, after having provided new substantial information which demonstrates that the products placed or made available on the Union market or intended to be exported from the Union market are in compliance with the prohibition of products made with forced labour. The lead competent authority should withdraw its decision for the future where the economic operators demonstrate that they have complied with that decision and eliminated forced labour from their operations or supply chains for the products concerned. Decisions of lead competent authorities pursuant to this Regulation should be subject to judicial review in accordance with the applicable Union and national law.\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nIf the economic operators fail to comply with the decision of the lead competent authority by the end of the established timeframe, the competent authorities should ensure that the products concerned are prohibited from being placed or made available on the Union market, or from being exported or are withdrawn from the Union market and that any perishable products remaining with the relevant economic operators are donated to charitable or public interest causes. Competent authorities should ensure that non-perishable products are recycled, or, if that is not possible, that they are destroyed, rendered inoperable, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with national law, consistent with Union law, including Union law on waste management and on ecodesign for sustainable products at the expense of the economic operators. Where possible, competent authorities should ensure that the disposal or destruction method chosen from all of the available options has the smallest environmental impact possible. Competent authorities of Member States should be responsible for the enforcement of decisions in their own territory, including decisions adopted by the Commission. After a decision is communicated via the ICSMS, all competent authorities concerned with that decision should proceed with the relevant enforcement actions provided for in this Regulation.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nThe effect on animal welfare should be considered when enforcing the prohibition of placing and making available on the market or exporting products made using forced labour in order to spare the animals concerned avoidable pain, distress or suffering. In addition, this Regulation should be without prejudice to Union law regarding animal welfare, such as Council Regulations (EC) No 1/2005 (19) and (EC) No 1099/2009 (20).\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nDecisions of the lead competent authorities establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour should be communicated to customs authorities, who should aim to identify the product concerned from products declared for release for free circulation or export. The competent authorities of the Member States should be responsible for the overall enforcement of the prohibition of products made with forced labour in the Union market as well as products entering or leaving that market. Since forced labour is part of the manufacturing process and does not leave any trace on the product, and as Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 covers only manufactured products and its scope is limited to release for free circulation, customs authorities would be unable to act autonomously under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 in the application and enforcement of the prohibition of products made with forced labour. The specific organisation of controls of each Member State should be without prejudice to Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) and its general provisions on the control and supervisory powers of customs authorities.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nThe information currently provided or made available to customs authorities by economic operators includes only general information on products but lacks information on the manufacturer or producer and product suppliers as well as specific information on products. In order for customs authorities to be able to identify products entering or leaving the Union market that breach this Regulation and should accordingly be stopped at the external borders of the Union, economic operators should submit to customs authorities information allowing for the identification of products to which a decision of the lead competent authority relates. This should include information on the manufacturer or producer and the product suppliers as well as any other information on the product itself. To this end, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts identifying the products for which such information should be provided using, inter alia, the database established under this Regulation as well as the information and decisions of the lead competent authorities encoded in the ICSMS. Moreover, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts necessary to specify the details of the information to be provided or made available to customs authorities by the economic operators. Such information should include the description, name or brand of the product, specific requirements under Union law for the identification of the product, such as a type, reference, model, batch or serial number affixed on the product, or provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the product, or the unique identifier of the digital product passport, as well as details on the manufacturer or producer and the product suppliers, including, for each of them, their name, trade name or registered trademark, their contact details, their unique identification number in the country they are established and, where available, their Economic Operators Registration and Identification number. The review of the Union Customs Code will consider introducing in customs legislation the information required to be provided or made available to customs authorities by economic operators for the enforcement of this Regulation and, more broadly, in order to strengthen the transparency of the supply chain. The Commission should issue guidance to and support economic operators, especially SMEs, on how to collect the required information.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nCustoms authorities that identify a product that may be covered by a decision communicated by the lead competent authority establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour should suspend the release of that product and notify the competent authorities immediately. Competent authorities should reach a conclusion within a reasonable timeframe on the case notified to them by the customs authorities, either by confirming or by denying that the product concerned is covered by a decision. Where necessary and duly justified, the competent authorities should be authorised to require maintaining the suspension of the release of the product concerned, taking into account the potential damage for the economic operator. In the absence of a conclusion by competent authorities within the specified time limit, customs authorities should release the products if all other applicable requirements and formalities are fulfilled. Generally, the release of a product for free circulation or export should not be deemed to be proof of compliance with Union law, since such a release does not necessarily include a complete assessment of such compliance.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nWhere the competent authorities conclude that a product corresponds to a decision establishing a violation of the prohibition of products made with forced labour, they should immediately inform customs authorities which should refuse its release for free circulation or export. Customs authorities should be able, where a competent authority so requests and on behalf and under the responsibility of that competent authority, to alternatively seize that product and put it at the disposal of and under the authority of that competent authority. In such cases, the relevant competent authority should take all the necessary measures to ensure that the product concerned is disposed of appropriately, including by way of its donation to charitable or public interest causes, its recycling or otherwise its disposal in accordance with national law consistent with Union law at the expense of the relevant economic operator.\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nThe lead competent authority should take into due consideration the risk of disengagement by economic operators who are either related to products or regions in the database, or who have had their product removed from the Union market, as well as the consequences on affected workers. The lead competent authority should therefore, where appropriate, support economic operators in adopting and carrying out suitable and effective measures for bringing forced labour to an end. Responsible disengagement includes complying with collective agreements and articulating escalation measures.\n\n(60)\n\n\t\n\nThe conditions applicable to products during the suspension of their release for free circulation or export, including their storage or destruction and disposal of in case of a refusal to release such products for free circulation, should be determined by customs authorities, where applicable, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 952/2013. Should products entering the Union market require further processing, they are to be placed under the appropriate customs procedure allowing such processing in accordance with Articles 220, 254, 256, 257 and 258 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.\n\n(61)\n\n\t\n\nWhere, in order to give effect to the prohibition of products made using forced labour, it is necessary to process personal data pursuant to this Regulation, such processing should be carried out in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data. Any processing of personal data under the prohibition of products made with forced labour should be subject to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (22) and (EU) 2018/1725 (23) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n(62)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the procedural rules and the details of the arrangements for the use of the ICSMS; the procedural rules, templates and details for the submission of information on alleged violations of the prohibition on the placing or making available of products made with forced labour on the Union market or exporting them; the decisions adopted by the Commission establishing that the prohibition on the placing or making available of products made with forced labour on the Union market or exporting them has been violated; the withdrawal of those decisions; the details of the content of those decisions and of the equivalent decisions adopted by the lead competent authorities; and the arrangements and details for providing or making available to the customs authorities certain information on specific products or product groups. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24).\n\n(63)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the withdrawal of the decisions establishing that the prohibition on the placing or making available or exporting of products made with forced labour has been violated, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n\n(64)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (25). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(65)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that the customs authorities are able to act effectively, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of further specifying the additional information identifying the product concerned that economic operators should make available or provide to the customs authorities as regards products entering or leaving the Union market. That information should be information identifying the product concerned, information about the manufacturer or the producer and information about the product suppliers. Customs authorities need to be enabled to obtain information rapidly on specific products identified in the decisions of the lead competent authorities in order to take actions and measures effectively and swiftly. In such cases, delegated acts should be adopted pursuant to an urgent procedure.\n\n(66)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should confer on their competent authorities the power to impose and implement effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in cases where the economic operator has failed to comply with a decision prohibiting the placing on the market of products made with forced labour. The rules on penalties, applicable in the event of non-compliance with a decision, should be established by Member States, giving due regard to elements such as the gravity and duration of the infringement, previous infringements by the economic operator, the degree of cooperation with competent authorities and any other mitigating or aggravating factor applicable to the circumstances of the particular case. The Commission should issue guidance for Member States on the method for calculating financial penalties and the thresholds applicable and the Union Network Against Forced Labour Products should promote best practices in the application of such penalties.\n\n(67)\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission should carry out an evaluation of the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation and submit a report thereon to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee. The report should assess the contribution of this Regulation to the elimination of products made with forced labour from the Union market and to the fight against forced labour as well as to the cooperation between competent authorities and international cooperation to eliminate forced labour. The report should also assess the impact of this Regulation on businesses, in particular SMEs, and on victims, as well as the overall costs and benefits of the prohibition of products made with forced labour. The report should further assess the alignment of this Regulation with other relevant Union law.\n\n(68)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation respects the right to good administration, enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter, which includes, inter alia, the right of every person to be heard, before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken. In this regard, the lead competent authority conducting the investigation should inform the economic operators concerned about the initiation of the investigation and the possible consequences thereof. To ensure their right to due process, economic operators should have the opportunity to provide information in their defence to the competent authorities upon their request during the investigation. Economic operators should have the possibility to request the lead competent authority to review the decision affecting them, by providing new substantial information. The decisions adopted by Member States’ competent authorities should be subject to judicial review foreseen in applicable national law. The decisions adopted by the Commission under this Regulation are subject to review by the Court of Justice of the European Union in accordance with Article 263 TFEU.\n\n(69)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely, prohibiting economic operators from placing and making available on the Union market or exporting from the Union market products made with forced labour in order to improve the functioning of the internal market, while contributing to the fight against forced labour, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n(70)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter, objective and scope\n\n1.   This Regulation lays down rules prohibiting economic

This database shall provide indicative, non-exhaustive, evidence-based, verifiable and regularly updated information on forced labour risks in specific geographic areas or with respect to specific products or product groups, including with regard to forced labour imposed by state authorities. The database shall prioritise the identification of widespread and severe forced labour risks.\n\n2.   The database referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on independent and verifiable information from international organisations, in particular the ILO and the UN, or institutional, research or academic organisations.\n\nThe database shall not publicly disclose information that names economic operators directly.\n\nThe database shall indicate specific economic sectors in specific geographic areas for which there is reliable and verifiable evidence that forced labour imposed by state authorities exists.\n\n3.   The Commission shall ensure that the database is easily accessible, including for persons with disabilities, and made publicly available, in all official languages of the institutions of the Union, by 14 June 2026.\n\nArticle 9\n\nSingle information submission point\n\n1.   The Commission shall set up a dedicated centralised mechanism for the submission of information (single information submission point). The single information submission point shall be available in all official languages of the institutions of the Union. It shall be user-friendly and made available free of charge.\n\n2.   Information on alleged violations of Article 3 shall be submitted via the single information submission point by any natural or legal person or any association that does not have a legal personality. Submissions of information shall contain information on the economic operators or products concerned, provide the reasons and evidence substantiating the alleged violations, and where possible, supporting documents. The Commission may adopt implementing acts to specify the procedural rules, templates and details in relation to those submissions of information. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 35(2).\n\n3.   The Commission shall discard any submissions of information to the single information submission point that are manifestly incomplete, unfounded or made in bad faith and distribute the retained submissions of information for assessment by the lead competent authority according to the method for the allocation of investigations set out in Article 15.\n\n4.   The lead competent authority in charge of the assessment referred to in paragraph 3 shall acknowledge receipt of the submission of information, diligently and impartially assess the information and inform the natural or legal person or association concerned of the outcome of the assessment of its submission of information as soon as possible.\n\n5.   The lead competent authority may ask the person or association referred to in paragraph 2 to provide additional information.\n\n6.   In cases where there is a significant lapse of time between the submission of information to the single information submission point and a decision to proceed with an investigation pursuant to Chapter III, the lead competent authority shall, to the extent possible, consult the person or association submitting the information to verify whether the situation has, to the best of their knowledge, changed significantly.\n\n7.   Directive (EU) 2019/1937 shall apply to the reporting of breaches of this Regulation and the protection of persons reporting such breaches.\n\nArticle 10\n\nSupport measures for SMEs\n\nThe Commission shall develop accompanying measures to support the efforts of economic operators and their business partners in the same supply chain, in particular SMEs. Where appropriate, information on those measures shall be made available through the Forced Labour Single Portal referred to in Article 12.\n\nCompetent authorities shall designate contact points to provide information to SMEs regarding matters related to the application of this Regulation. Those contact points may also provide assistance to SMEs on those matters.\n\nMember States’ competent authorities may also organise training sessions for economic operators on forced labour risk indicators and on how to engage in dialogue with those competent authorities throughout an investigation.\n\nArticle 11\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe Commission, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, shall make available, by 14 June 2026, and regularly update, guidelines which shall include the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for economic operators on due diligence in relation to forced labour, including forced child labour, which shall take into account applicable Union and national law, setting out due diligence requirements with respect to forced labour, guidelines and recommendations from international organisations, as well as the size and economic resources of economic operators, different types of suppliers along the supply chain, and different sectors;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for economic operators on best practices for bringing to an end and remediating different types of forced labour;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for competent authorities on the practical implementation of this Regulation, in particular Articles 8, 17 and 18, including benchmarks for assisting competent authorities in their risk-based assessments in the context of investigations and guidelines on the applicable standard of evidence;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for customs authorities and economic operators on the practical implementation of Article 27 and, where appropriate, any other provision laid down in Chapter V, Section II;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\ninformation on the risk indicators of forced labour, including how to identify such indicators, which shall be based on independent and verifiable information, including reports from international organisations, in particular the ILO, civil society, business organisations and trade unions, and on experience from implementing Union law setting out due diligence requirements regarding forced labour;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for economic operators on due diligence in relation to forced labour imposed by state authorities;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for economic operators and product suppliers on how to engage in dialogue with competent authorities pursuant to Chapter III, in particular on the type of information to be submitted;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nguidance on how to submit information pursuant to Article 9;\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nguidance for Member States on the method for calculating financial penalties and the applicable thresholds;\n\n(j)\n\n\t\n\nfurther information to facilitate the competent authorities’ implementation of and the economic operator’s compliance with this Regulation.\n\nThe guidance referred to in points (a), (b) and (f), shall focus in particular on assisting SMEs to comply with this Regulation.\n\nThe guidelines referred to in the first paragraph shall be consistent with guidelines provided in accordance with other relevant Union law.\n\nArticle 12\n\nForced Labour Single Portal\n\nThe Commission shall establish and regularly update a single website (Forced Labour Single Portal), making available to the public, in the same place and in all the official languages of the institutions of the Union, the following items:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe names, addresses and contact details of the competent authorities;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe guidelines;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe database;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\na list of publicly available information sources of relevance for the implementation of this Regulation, including sources which make disaggregated data available on the impact and victims of forced labour, such as gender-disaggregated data or data about forced child labour, allowing age and gender-specific trends to be identified;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\nthe single information submission point;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nany decision to ban a product;\n\n(g)\n\n\t\n\nany withdrawal of a ban;\n\n(h)\n\n\t\n\nthe result of reviews.\n\nArticle 13\n\nInternational Cooperation\n\n1.   In order to facilitate the effective implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, the Commission shall, as appropriate, cooperate and exchange information with the authorities of third countries, international organisations, civil society representatives, trade unions, business organisations and other relevant stakeholders.\n\n2.   International cooperation with the authorities of third countries shall take place in a structured way, for example in the context of existing dialogues with third countries, such as human rights and political dialogues, dialogues on the implementation of the trade and sustainable development commitments of trade agreements or the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, and Union development cooperation initiatives. If necessary, specific dialogues may be created on an ad hoc basis. International cooperation may involve exchanges of information on forced labour risk areas or products, of best practices for bringing forced labour to an end, and of information on decisions to ban products, including their reasons and evidence, in particular with third countries that have similar legislation in place.\n\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the Commission and Member States may consider the development of cooperation initiatives and accompanying measures to support the efforts of economic operators, in particular SMEs, as well as civil society organisations, social partners and third countries to tackle forced labour and its root causes.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\nArticle 14\n\nRisk-based approach\n\n1.   The Commission and the competent authorities of Member States shall follow a risk-based approach when assessing the likelihood of a violation of Article 3, when initiating and conducting the preliminary phase of the investigations and when identifying the products and economic operators concerned.\n\n2.   In their assessment of the likelihood of a violation of Article 3, the Commission and the competent authorities shall use the following criteria, as appropriate, in order to prioritise products suspected to have been made with forced labour:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe scale and severity of the suspected forced labour, including whether forced labour imposed by state authorities could be a concern;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe quantity or volume of products placed or made available on the Union market;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe share of the part of the product suspected to have been made with forced labour in the final product.\n\n3.   The assessment of the likelihood of a violation of Article 3 shall be based on all relevant, factual, and verifiable information available to the Commission and competent authorities, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\ninformation and decisions encoded in the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1), including any previous cases of compliance or non-compliance of an economic operator with Article 3;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe database referred to in Article 8;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe risk indicators and other information pursuant to Article 11, point (e);\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nsubmissions of information made pursuant to Article 9;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\ninformation received by the Commission or the competent authority from other authorities relevant for the implementation of this Regulation, such as Member States’ due diligence, labour, health or fiscal authorities, on the products and economic operators under assessment;\n\n(f)\n\n\t\n\nany issues arising from meaningful consultations with relevant stakeholders, such as civil society organisations and trade unions.\n\n4.   When initiating a preliminary investigation pursuant to Article 17, the lead competent authority shall, to the extent possible, focus on the economic operators and, where relevant, product suppliers involved in the steps of the supply chain as close as possible to where the forced labour is likely occurring, and with the highest leverage to prevent, mitigate and bring to an end the use of forced labour. The lead competent authority shall also take into account the size and economic resources of the economic operators concerned, in particular whether the economic operator is an SME, and the complexity of the supply chain.\n\nArticle 15\n\nAllocation of investigations\n\n1.   Where the suspected forced labour is taking place outside the territory of the Union, the Commission shall act as the lead competent authority.\n\n2.   Where the suspected forced labour is taking place in the territory of a Member State, a competent authority of that Member State shall act as the lead competent authority.\n\nArticle 16\n\nCoordination of investigations and mutual assistance\n\n1.   The Commission and competent authorities shall cooperate closely with each other and provide each other with mutual assistance in order to implement this Regulation in a consistent and efficient manner.\n\n2.   The lead competent authority shall respect the right of the economic operator to be heard at all stages of the process.\n\n3.   The lead competent authority shall, at any time and without undue delay, communicate via the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1) in the event that it discovers new information about suspected forced labour taking place in a territory for which it is not competent pursuant to Article 15.\n\n4.   The lead competent authority may request the support of other relevant competent authorities. This may include requesting support in order to contact economic operators whose place of establishment is within the territory of that Member State or whose language of operation is that of a Member State. Other competent authorities that have an interest in the investigation may request to be closely involved in the investigation.\n\n5.   A competent authority that has received, through the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1), a request for information from another competent authority shall provide an answer within 20 working days of the date of receipt of the request.\n\n6.   The competent authority that has received a request for information may ask the requesting competent authority to complement the information contained in the request if it concludes that the information provided initially is not sufficient.\n\n7.   The competent authority that has received a request for information may refuse to comply with that request only if it demonstrates that complying with the request would substantially impair the execution of its own activities.\n\nArticle 17\n\nPreliminary phase of investigations\n\n1.   Before initiating an investigation in accordance with Article 18(1), the lead competent authority shall request information from the economic operators under assessment and, where relevant, other product suppliers, on the relevant actions they have taken in order to identify, prevent, mitigate, bring to an end or remediate risks of forced labour in their operations and supply chains with respect to the products under assessment, including on the basis of any of the following, unless it would jeopardise the outcome of the assessment:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\napplicable Union or national law setting out due diligence and transparency requirements with respect to forced labour;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe guidelines issued by the Commission;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\ndue diligence guidelines or recommendations of the UN, ILO, OECD or other relevant international organisations, in particular guidelines and recommendations relating to geographic areas, production sites and economic activities in certain sectors in which there are systematic and widespread forced labour practices;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nany other meaningful due diligence or other information in relation to forced labour in their supply chain.\n\nThe lead competent authority may request information on those actions from other relevant stakeholders, including the persons or associations that have submitted relevant, factual, and verifiable information pursuant to Article 9 and any other natural or legal persons related to the products and geographical areas under assessment, as well as from the European External Action Service and Union delegations in relevant third countries.\n\n2.   Economic operators shall respond to the request referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article within 30 working days of the day they received such request. Economic operators may provide any other information they may deem useful for the purposes of this Article. Where necessary, economic operators may request support from a contact point referred to in Article 10, on how to engage with the lead competent authority.\n\n3.   Within 30 working days from the date of receipt of the information submitted by economic operators pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the lead competent authority shall conclude the preliminary phase of its investigation regarding whether there is a substantiated concern that there has been a violation of Article 3, on the basis of the assessment referred to in Article 14(3) and the information submitted by economic operators pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article.\n\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3 of this Article, the lead competent authority may conclude that there is a substantiated concern that there has been a violation of Article 3 on the basis of any other facts available, where a lead competent authority has refrained from requesting information in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article or in the situations referred to in Article 20(2), points (a) to (e).\n\n5.   The lead competent authority shall not initiate an investigation pursuant to Article 18, and shall inform the economic operators under assessment accordingly, where, on the basis of the assessment referred to in Article 14(3) and, if any, of the information submitted by economic operators pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, it considers that there is no substantiated concern that there has been a violation of Article 3, or that the reasons that motivated the existence of a substantiated concern have been eliminated, for instance due to, but not limited to, the applicable legislation, guidelines, recommendations or any other due diligence in relation to forced labour as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article being applied in a way that mitigates, prevents and brings to an end the risk of forced labour.\n\n6.   The lead competent authority shall communicate, through the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1), the outcome of its assessment pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.\n\nArticle 18\n\nInvestigations\n\n1.   The lead competent authority that determines, pursuant to paragraphs 3 or 4 of Article 17, that there is a substantiated concern that there has been a violation of Article 3, shall initiate an investigation on the products and economic operators concerned and inform the economic operators subject to the investigation, within 3 working days of the date of the decision to initiate such investigation, of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe initiation of the investigation and the possible consequences thereof;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe products subject to the investigation;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe reasons for the initiation of the investigation, unless it would jeopardise the outcome of the investigation;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe right of the economic operators to submit documents or information to the lead competent authority, and the date by which such information is to be submitted.\n\n2.   The lead competent authority shall communicate, through the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1), that an investigation has been initiated pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n3.   Where requested by the lead competent authority, economic operators under investigation shall submit any information that is relevant and necessary for the investigation, including information identifying the products under investigation and, where appropriate, identifying the part of the product to which the investigation should be limited, as well as the manufacturer, producer, product supplier, the importer or the exporter of those products or parts thereof. In requesting such information, the lead competent authority shall, to the extent possible, prioritise the economic operators under investigation involved in the steps of the supply chain as close as possible to where the forced labour is likely occurring, and take into account the size and economic resources of the economic operators, in particular whether the economic operator is an SME, the quantity of products concerned, the complexity of the supply chain, as well as the scale of suspected forced labour. Where necessary, economic operators may request support from a contact point referred to in Article 10 on how to engage with the lead competent authority.\n\n4.   The lead competent authority shall set a deadline of at least 30 working days and no longer than 60 working days for economic operators to submit the information referred to in paragraph 3. Economic operators may request an extension of that deadline with a justification. When deciding whether to grant such an extension, the lead competent authority shall consider the size and economic resources of the economic operators concerned, including whether the economic operator is an SME.\n\n5.   The lead competent authority may collect information from or interview any relevant natural or legal person who consents to be interviewed for the purpose of collecting information relating to the subject matter of the investigation, including relevant economic operators or any other stakeholders.\n\n6.   The lead competent authority may, where necessary, carry out all necessary checks and inspections in accordance with Article 19.\n\nArticle 19\n\nField inspections\n\n1.   In exceptional situations where the lead competent authority deems it necessary to conduct field inspections, it shall do so taking into consideration where the risk of forced labour is located.\n\n2.   Where the risk of forced labour is located in the territory of the Member State, the lead competent authority may conduct its own inspections, in accordance with national law in compliance with Union law. If necessary, the lead competent authority may request cooperation from other national authorities relevant for the implementation of this Regulation, such as labour, health or fiscal authorities.\n\n3.   Where the risk of forced labour is located outside the territory of the Union, the Commission acting as lead competent authority may carry out all necessary checks and inspections provided that the economic operators concerned give their consent and that the government of the third country in which the inspections are to take place has been officially notified and raises no objection. The Commission may request assistance from the European External Action Service, as appropriate, to facilitate such contacts.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nDECISIONS\n\nArticle 20\n\nDecisions regarding the violation of Article 3\n\n1.   The lead competent authority shall assess all information and evidence gathered pursuant to Chapter III, and, on that basis, establish whether the products, that have been placed or made available on the market or are being exported, are in violation of Article 3, within a reasonable period of time from the date it initiated the investigation pursuant to Article 18(1). The lead competent authority shall endeavour to adopt the decision referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article or close the investigation within 9 months from the date it initiated the investigation.\n\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the lead competent authority may establish that Article 3 has been violated on the basis of any other facts available where it was not possible to gather information and evidence pursuant to Article 17(1) and Article 18(3), in particular where, in response to a request for information, an economic operator or a public authority:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nrefuses to provide the information requested without a valid justification;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nfails to provide the information requested within the time limit prescribed without a valid justification;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nprovides incomplete or incorrect information with the objective of blocking the investigation;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nprovides misleading information; or\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\notherwise impedes the investigation, including when a risk of forced labour imposed by state authorities is identified during the preliminary phase of the investigation or during the investigation.\n\n3.   Where the lead competent authority cannot establish that the products concerned have been placed or made available on the market or are being exported in violation of Article 3, it shall close the investigation and inform the economic operators that have been subject to the investigation thereof. It shall also inform all other competent authorities through the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1). Closing the investigation shall not preclude the initiation of a new investigation into the same product and economic operator in the case of new relevant information.\n\n4.   Where the lead competent authority establishes that the products concerned have been placed or made available on the market or are being exported in violation of Article 3, it shall, without delay, adopt a decision containing:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na prohibition on the placing or making available of the products concerned on the Union market and on exporting them;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nan order requiring the economic operators that have been subject to the investigation to withdraw the products that have already been placed or made available on the Union market or to remove content from an online interface referring to the products or listings of the products concerned;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nan order requiring the economic operators that have been subject to the investigation to dispose of the products concerned in accordance with Article 25 or, if parts of the product which are found to be in violation of Article 3 are replaceable, an order requiring those economic operators to dispose of those parts of that product.\n\nWhere relevant, the prohibition referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph and the order referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph shall identify the parts of the product found to be in violation of Article 3, that must be replaced in order for the product to be placed or made available on the market or exported.\n\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, first subparagraph, point (c), and, where appropriate, in order to prevent disruptions to a supply chain of strategic or critical importance for the Union, the lead competent authority may refrain from imposing an order to dispose of the product concerned pursuant to paragraph 4. The lead competent authority may instead order that the product concerned be withheld for a defined period of time, which shall be no longer than the time necessary to eliminate forced labour with regard to the product concerned, at the cost of the economic operators.\n\nIf economic operators demonstrate, during that period of time, that they have eliminated forced labour from the supply chain with regard to the product concerned, without changing that product and by bringing to an end the forced labour identified in the decision referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, the lead competent authority shall review its decision in accordance with Article 21.\n\nIf economic operators do not demonstrate, during that period of time, that they have eliminated forced labour from the supply chain with regard to the product concerned, without changing that product and by bringing to an end the forced labour identified in the decision referred to in paragraph 4, point (c) of that paragraph shall apply.\n\n6.   Where the Commission acts as the lead competent authority, the decision referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article shall be adopted by means of an implementing act. Such implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 35(2).\n\n7.   The lead competent authority shall notify the decision referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article to all of the economic operators it is addressed to and communicate it to all competent authorities and, where applicable, to the Commission through the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1).\n\n8.   Decisions taken by a lead competent authority of a Member State, pursuant to paragraph 4, shall be recognised and enforced by competent authorities in the other Member States, insofar as they relate to products with the same identification information and as originating from the same supply chain which has been found to be using forced labour.\n\nArticle 21\n\nReview of decisions regarding the violation of Article 3\n\n1.   The lead competent authority shall allow economic operators affected by a decision referred to in Article 20 to request a review of that decision at any time. The request for a review shall contain information which demonstrates that the products are placed or made available on the market or are to be exported in compliance with Article 3. That information shall contain new substantial information that was not brought to the attention of the lead competent authority during the investigation.\n\n2.   The lead competent authority shall take a decision on the request referred to in paragraph 1 within 30 working days of the receipt of that request.\n\n3.   Where economic operators have demonstrated that they have complied with the decision referred to in Article 20, and that they have eliminated forced labour from their operations or supply chain with respect to the products concerned, the lead competent authority shall withdraw its decision for the future, inform the economic operators and remove it from the Forced Labour Single Portal.\n\n4.   Where the Commission acts as the lead competent authority, the withdrawal referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be implemented by means of an implementing act. Such implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 35(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of rights of defence and of property of the economic operators concerned, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 35(3). Those implementing acts shall remain in force for a period not exceeding 12 months.\n\n5.   Economic operators that have been affected by a decision referred to in Article 20 of a lead competent authority of a Member State shall have access to a court or tribunal to review the procedural and substantive legality of the decision.\n\n6.   Paragraph 5 is without prejudice to any provision of national law which requires that administrative review procedures be exhausted prior to recourse to judicial proceedings.\n\n7.   Decisions referred to in Article 20 adopted by a lead competent authority of a Member State are without prejudice to any decisions of a judicial nature taken by national courts or tribunals of the Member States with respect to the same economic operators or products.\n\nArticle 22\n\nContent of decisions\n\n1.   The decision referred to in Article 20 shall contain all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe findings of the investigation and the information and evidence underpinning the findings;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nreasonable time limits for the economic operators to comply with the orders, which shall not be less than 30 working days; in the case of perishable goods, animals and plants, the time limit shall not be less than 10 working days; when setting the time limits, the lead competent authority shall take into account the economic operator’s size and economic resources, including whether the operator is an SME, the share of the part of the product and whether it is replaceable; the time limits shall be proportionate to the time needed to comply with the different orders and no longer than necessary;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nall relevant information, in particular the details allowing the identification of the product to which the decision applies, including details about the manufacturer, producer, the product suppliers, the importer, the exporter and, where appropriate, the production site;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nwhere available and applicable, information required under customs legislation as defined in Article 5, point 2, of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013;\n\n(e)\n\n\t\n\ninformation on the taking of a judicial review against a decision.\n\n2.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts further specifying the details of the information to be included in the decision referred to in Article 20. Those details shall, at minimum, include details of the information to be provided or made available to customs authorities in accordance with Article 27(3) in order to enable the identification of products pursuant to Article 26(4). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure pursuant to Article 35(2).\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nENFORCEMENT\n\nSection I\n\nCompetent authorities\n\nArticle 23\n\nEnforcement of decisions\n\n1.   Where, within the reasonable time limit referred to in Article 22(1), point (b), an economic operator has failed to comply with the decision referred to in Article 20, the competent authorities shall be responsible for the enforcement of that decision and shall ensure all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nthe prohibition on the placing or making available of the products concerned on the Union market and on the export of them;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe withdrawal from the Union market by relevant authorities of products that have already been placed or made available on the market, in accordance with Union and national law;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nthe disposal of withdrawn products and products remaining with the economic operator in accordance with Article 25, at the expense of that economic operator;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nthe restriction of access to the products concerned and to listings referring to those products by requesting the relevant third party to implement such restriction.\n\n2.   If the economic operator has failed to comply with the decision referred to in Article 20, the competent authority shall impose either directly, in cooperation with other authorities, or by way of an application to the competent judicial authorities, penalties on the economic operator concerned pursuant to Article 37.\n\nArticle 24\n\nWithdrawal and disposal of products made with forced labour\n\n1.   An order to withdraw and dispose of products placed or made available on the Union market pursuant to Article 20(4) of this Regulation shall be communicated, through the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1) of this Regulation, to the market surveillance authorities referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and any other relevant authorities for the products concerned.\n\n2.   The enforcement of the withdrawal and disposal of the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the responsibility of the competent authority, in coordination with any other relevant authorities for the products concerned.\n\nArticle 25\n\nManner of disposal of products made with forced labour\n\nIn line with the waste hierarchy set out in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (27), economic operators and the Member States competent authorities responsible for the disposal of products, as required by Article 20(4), point (c), and Article 23(1), point (c), of this Regulation, respectively, shall dispose of those products by recycling them or, when that is not possible, by rendering those products inoperable. Perishable products, shall be donated for charitable or public interest purposes or, when that is not possible, be rendered inoperable.\n\nSection II\n\nCustoms authorities\n\nArticle 26\n\nControls by customs authorities\n\n1.   Products entering or leaving the Union market shall be subject to the controls and measures laid down in this Section.\n\n2.   The application of this Section is without prejudice to any other Union legal act governing customs risk management, customs controls and the release of goods for free circulation and export, in particular Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.\n\n3.   The lead competent authority shall, without delay, communicate to the customs authorities of Member States decisions referred to in Article 20 to prohibit the placing or making available of products on the Union market and their export.\n\n4.   Customs authorities shall rely on the decisions communicated pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article to identify products that may not comply with the prohibition laid down in Article 3 of this Regulation. For that purpose, they shall carry out controls on products entering or leaving the Union market based on risk management as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.\n\n5.   The lead competent authority shall, without delay, communicate to the customs authorities of Member States any withdrawal of, as well as any changes to a decision pursuant to a review in accordance with Article 21.\n\nArticle 27\n\nAdditional information to be provided or made available to customs authorities\n\n1.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 33 to supplement this Regulation by identifying the products or product groups for which the information referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be provided to customs authorities.

Customs authorities shall immediately notify the competent authorities of their Member State of that suspension and transmit all relevant information to enable them to establish whether the product is covered by a decision communicated pursuant to Article 26(3).\n\nArticle 29\n\nRelease for free circulation or export\n\n1.   Where the release for free circulation or the export of a product has been suspended in accordance with Article 28, that product shall be released for free circulation or exported where all the other requirements and formalities relating to such a release or export have been fulfilled and where either of the following conditions is satisfied:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nwithin 4 working days of the suspension, if the competent authorities have not requested the customs authorities to maintain the suspension; in case of perishable products, animals and plants that time limit shall be 2 working days;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nthe competent authorities informed the customs authorities of their approval for release for free circulation or export pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n2.   The release for free circulation or export pursuant to paragraph 1 shall not be deemed proof of compliance with Union law and, in particular, with this Regulation.\n\nArticle 30\n\nRefusal to release for free circulation or export\n\n1.   Where the competent authorities conclude that a product, which has been notified to them in accordance with Article 28, is a product made with forced labour pursuant to a decision referred to in Article 20, they shall require customs authorities not to release it for free circulation or to allow its export.\n\n2.   Competent authorities shall immediately enter the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in the information and communication system referred to in Article 7(1) and notify the customs authorities accordingly. Upon receipt of such notification, customs authorities shall not allow the release for free circulation or export of that product and shall also include the following notice in the customs data-processing system and, where possible, on the commercial invoice accompanying the product and any other relevant accompanying document:\n\n‘Product made with forced labour – release for free circulation/export not authorised – Regulation (EU) 2024/3015’.\n\n3.   Where the release for free circulation or export of a product has been refused in accordance with paragraph 1, customs authorities shall dispose of that product in accordance with national law in compliance with Union law.\n\n4.   Upon the request of a competent authority, and on behalf and under the responsibility of that competent authority, customs authorities may alternatively seize the product the release for free circulation or export of which has been refused and put it at the disposal of and under the authority of that competent authority. In such cases, that competent authority shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the product concerned is disposed of in accordance with Article 25.\n\nArticle 31\n\nExchange of information and cooperation\n\n1.   To enable a risk-based analysis of products entering or leaving the Union market and to ensure that controls are effective and performed in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation, the Commission, competent authorities and customs authorities shall cooperate closely and exchange risk-related information. To that end, the Commission shall take on a coordination role.\n\n2.   Cooperation among authorities and exchange of risk-related information necessary for the fulfilment of their functions under this Regulation, including through electronic means, shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 952/2013:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nbetween customs authorities;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nbetween competent authorities and customs authorities.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 32\n\nConfidentiality\n\n1.   The competent authorities shall only use information received pursuant to this Regulation for the purpose of applying this Regulation, unless otherwise required by Union or national law in compliance with Union law.\n\n2.   The Commission, Member States and competent authorities shall treat the identity of those who provide information, or the information provided, as confidential, in accordance with Union or national law in compliance with Union law, unless stated otherwise by those who provided the information.\n\n3.   Paragraph 2 shall not preclude the Commission from disclosing general information in a summary form, provided such general information does not contain any information which allows the identification of the provider of the information. Such disclosure of general information in a summary form shall take into account the legitimate interest of the parties concerned in preventing the disclosure of confidential information.\n\nArticle 33\n\nExercise of the delegation\n\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n\n2.   The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 27(1) shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time from 13 December 2024.\n\n3.   The delegation of power referred to in Article 27(1) may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council.

That period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\n\nArticle 34\n\nUrgency procedure\n\n1.   Delegated acts adopted under this Article shall enter into force without delay and shall apply as long as no objection is expressed in accordance with paragraph 2. The notification of a delegated act to the European Parliament and to the Council shall state the reasons for the use of the urgency procedure.\n\n2.   Either the European Parliament or the Council may object to a delegated act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 33(6). In such a case, the Commission shall repeal the act immediately following the notification of the decision to object by the European Parliament or by the Council.\n\nArticle 35\n\nCommittee procedure\n\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a committee.

The Commission’s Communication of 22 November 2016 entitled ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for sustainability’ links the SDGs to the Union policy framework to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both within the Union and globally, take the SDGs on board at the outset. The European Council conclusions of 22 and 23 June 2017 confirmed the commitment of the Union and the Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in a full, coherent, comprehensive, integrated and effective manner and in close cooperation with partners and other stakeholders. In addition, the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment has, at the time of adoption of this Regulation, more than 5 300 signatories representing over EUR 120 trillion of assets under management. On 11 December 2019, the Commission published its communication entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’). On 30 June 2021, the European Climate Law was adopted as Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), which enshrines in Union law the goal set out in the European Green Deal of Union economy and society becoming climate-neutral by 2050.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nThe transition to a sustainable economy is key to ensuring the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of the Union economy and the quality of life of citizens in the Union, and to keeping global warming well below the 1,5 degree Celsius threshold. Sustainability has long been at the heart of Union policies and both the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) recognise its social and environmental dimensions.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nAchieving the objectives of the SDGs in the Union requires the channelling of capital flows towards sustainable investments. It is necessary to fully exploit the potential of the internal market for the achievement of those objectives. In that context, it is crucial to remove obstacles to the efficient movement of capital towards sustainable investments in the internal market, to prevent such obstacles from emerging, and to set rules and standards to, on the one hand, promote sustainable finance and, on the other, disincentivise investments that can adversely impact the achievement of the objectives of the SDGs.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nThe Union’s approach to sustainable and inclusive growth is anchored in the 20 principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, as laid down in the Commission’s Communication of 26 April 2017 entitled ‘Establishing a European Pillar of Social Rights’, which aim to ensure a fair transition towards such growth and to ensure policies which leave no one behind. Furthermore, the Union social acquis, including the Union of Equality Strategies, provides standards in the areas of labour law, equality, accessibility, health and safety at work, and anti-discrimination.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nFinancial markets play a crucial role in the channelling of capital towards investments that are necessary for the achievement of the Union climate and environmental objectives. In its communication of 8 March 2018, the Commission published its Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, launching its strategy on sustainable finance. The objectives of that Action Plan are to mainstream sustainability factors into risk management and reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nAs part of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, in 2021 the Commission commissioned a study entitled ‘Study on Sustainability-Related Ratings, Data and Research’ to take stock of the developments in the sustainability-related products and services market, identify the main market participants and highlight potential shortcomings. That study provided an inventory and classification of market actors, sustainability products and services available in the market and an analysis of the use and perceived quality of sustainability-related products and services by market participants. The study highlighted the existence of conflicts of interest, the lack of transparency and accuracy of environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings methodologies and the lack of clarity over the terminology and the operations of ESG rating providers.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nIn the framework of the European Green Deal, the Commission put forward an updated sustainable finance strategy, which was adopted in its communication of 6 July 2021 entitled ‘Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy’.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nAs a follow-up, the Commission announced in that strategy a public consultation on ESG ratings to feed into an impact assessment. In the public consultation that took place in 2022, stakeholders confirmed concerns regarding the lack of transparency of ESG rating methodologies and objectives and clarity over ESG rating activities. As trust is pivotal in the functioning of financial markets, such lack of transparency and reliability of ESG ratings should be urgently addressed.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nAt international level, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) issued a report in November 2021 containing a set of recommendations on ESG ratings and data product providers. The Commission and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) should consider the application of those IOSCO recommendations when assessing the compliance of a third-country jurisdiction or ESG rating provider with the requirements of this Regulation for the purpose of equivalence, endorsement or recognition.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nESG ratings play an important role in global capital markets, as investors, borrowers and issuers increasingly use ESG ratings as part of the process of making informed decisions relating to sustainable investment and financing. Credit institutions, investment firms, insurance undertakings, assurance undertakings and reinsurance undertakings, amongst others, often use ESG ratings as a reference for the sustainability performance or the sustainability risks and opportunities in their investment activity. Consequently, ESG ratings have a significant impact on the operation of markets and on the trust and confidence of investors and consumers. To ensure that ESG ratings used in the Union are independent, comparable where possible, impartial, systematic and of adequate quality, it is important that ESG rating activities are conducted in accordance with the principles of integrity, transparency, responsibility and good governance, while contributing to the sustainable finance agenda of the Union. Better comparability and increased reliability of ESG ratings would enhance the efficiency of that fast-growing market, thereby facilitating progress towards the objectives of the European Green Deal.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nESG ratings play an enabling role for the proper functioning of the Union sustainable finance market by providing investors and financial institutions with important information for their investment strategies, risk management and disclosure obligations. It is therefore necessary to ensure that ESG ratings provide material decision-useful information to users of ESG ratings, and that users of ESG ratings better understand the objectives pursued by ESG ratings and the specific issues and metrics measured by such ratings.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to acknowledge the various business models of the ESG rating market. A first business model is the user-paid model, where users of ESG ratings are mainly investors that purchase ESG ratings for the purpose of making investment decisions. A second business model is the issuer-paid model, where undertakings purchase ESG ratings for the purpose of assessing risks and opportunities within their operations. In order to ensure greater reliability of ESG ratings provided in the Union, rated items or, in the case of a financial instrument or a financial product, issuers of rated items should have the possibility of verifying the data used by an ESG rating provider and of highlighting any factual errors in the dataset used that could potentially impact the quality of future ratings. To that end, a rated item or an issuer of a rated item should be able to access, upon request, the dataset used to issue the ESG rating. The possibility of verifying that dataset should be a pure fact-checking tool and rated items or issuers of rated items should under no circumstances be able to influence in any manner the rating methodologies or rating outcome. The requirement for an ESG rating provider to notify the rated item or the issuer of a rated item before the issuance of the ESG rating should only apply before the first issuance of the rating and not to any following updates. That requirement serves as a means to inform the rated item or the issuer of a rated item that it is going to be rated by the ESG rating provider.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nMember States neither regulate nor supervise the activities of ESG rating providers or the conditions for the provision of ESG ratings. Given the existing divergences, lack of transparency and absence of common rules, it is likely that Member States would adopt diverging measures and approaches impeding alignment with the objectives of the SDGs and the European Green Deal. Those diverging measures and approaches would have a direct negative impact on, and create obstacles to, the proper functioning of the internal market and be detrimental to the ESG rating market. ESG rating providers issuing ESG ratings for the use of financial institutions and undertakings in the Union would be subject to different rules in different Member States. Divergent standards and market practices would make it difficult to have clarity over the construction of ESG ratings and to compare them, thus creating uneven market conditions for users of ESG ratings. That would cause additional barriers within the internal market and would risk distorting investment decisions.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation complements existing Union legal acts in the field of sustainable finance and aims to facilitate information flows in order to facilitate investment decisions.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to adequately define the territorial scope, this Regulation should be based on the concept of ‘operating in the Union’, distinguishing between, on the one hand, cases where ESG rating providers are established in the Union and, on the other, cases where ESG rating providers are established outside the Union. In the first case, ESG rating providers established in the Union should be considered to be operating in the Union when they issue and publish their ESG ratings on their website or through other means, or when they issue and distribute their ESG ratings by subscription or other contractual relationships to regulated financial undertakings in the Union, to undertakings within the scope of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), to undertakings within the scope of Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), in particular with respect to third-country issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on Union regulated markets, or to Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or Member State public authorities. In the second case, ESG rating providers established outside the Union should only be considered to be operating in the Union when they issue and distribute their ESG ratings by subscription or other contractual relationships to the same entities as ESG rating providers established in the Union.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation is designed to govern the issuance, distribution and, where relevant, publication of ESG ratings, without being intended to regulate their use. Given that the territorial scope of this Regulation is tied to the concept of ‘operating in the Union’, users of ESG ratings should engage with ESG rating providers that are authorised or registered under this Regulation. Nevertheless, in limited cases, a user of ESG ratings in the Union should be able to engage with an ESG rating provider established outside the Union and not authorised or recognised under this Regulation. Such cases should strictly adhere to specific conditions to avoid any risk of circumvention of the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nTo adequately define the range of products to which this Regulation applies, the definition of ESG rating should be limited to opinions or scores, or a combination thereof, that are based on both an established methodology and a defined ranking system such as rating categories. For instance, the assignment of an item to a category or a scale that is either positive or negative, based on an established methodology with regard to environmental, social and human rights, or governance factors or with regard to exposure to risks, should be considered a ranking system for the purposes of this Regulation.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should not apply to the publication or distribution of data on environmental, social and human rights, and governance factors that do not result in the development of an ESG rating. Moreover, this Regulation should not apply to products or services that incorporate an element of an ESG rating, including investment research as laid down in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). External reviews of European Green Bonds, as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2023/2631 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), and external reviews and second-party opinions on bonds marketed as environmentally sustainable, sustainability-linked bonds, and bonds, loans and other types of debt instruments marketed as sustainable, should also fall outside the scope of this Regulation to the extent that such external reviews and second-party opinions do not contain ESG ratings issued by the external reviewer or the second-party opinion provider. External reviews include reviews of pre-issuance disclosures, such as European Green Bond factsheets or frameworks of bonds marketed as sustainable, as well as reviews of post-issuance disclosures, such as European Green Bond annual allocation reports, European Green Bond impact reports and reports on bonds marketed as sustainable. Furthermore, this Regulation should not apply to ratings developed exclusively for accreditation or certification processes, as such ratings do not target investment analysis, financial analysis, investment decision-making or financial decision-making. Lastly, this Regulation should not apply to ESG labelling activities provided that the labels granted to entities, financial instruments or products do not involve the disclosure of an ESG rating.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nIn addition, this Regulation should not apply to ratings issued by members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) when such ratings are not published or distributed for commercial purposes. That limitation in scope is to ensure that this Regulation does not unintentionally have an impact on measures of the ESCB that seek to take climate or other environmental, social and governance considerations into account in the ESCB’s monetary policy collateral framework when the ESCB is pursuing the primary objective of maintaining price stability and, without prejudice to that objective, supporting the general economic policies in the Union.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nWhere an undertaking or financial institution discloses information about its own sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities, or those of its value chain, such information should not be considered an ESG rating under this Regulation.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should not apply to private ESG ratings issued pursuant to an individual order and provided exclusively to the person who placed the order and which are not intended for public disclosure or for distribution by subscription or other means. Nor should this Regulation apply to ESG ratings issued by regulated financial undertakings in the Union that are used exclusively for internal purposes or for providing in-house or intragroup financial services or products.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to further enhance the functioning of the internal market and the level of investor protection, it is important to ensure sufficient and consistent transparency of ESG ratings issued by regulated financial undertakings in the Union and incorporated in their financial products or services when such ratings are disclosed and are therefore visible to third parties. Investors should receive adequate information about the methodologies underlying the ESG ratings, which should be disclosed in the marketing communications. Therefore, this Regulation should also complement the disclosure obligations related to marketing communications established by Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). The same information should also be required from any other regulated financial undertaking in the Union that discloses an ESG rating issued by that regulated financial undertaking to a third party as part of its marketing communications, except where it is subject to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Investors should receive, via a link to the disclosures on the website of the regulated financial undertaking in the Union, the same information as that required from an ESG rating provider pursuant to point 1 of Annex III of this Regulation, while taking into account the content of any information already disclosed by financial market participants and financial advisors pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Other regulated financial undertakings in the Union should disclose the same information, taking into account the various types of financial products, their characteristics and the differences between them, as well as the need to avoid any duplication of information already published pursuant to other applicable regulatory requirements. In general, any duplication of applicable disclosure requirements should be avoided. With that same objective, regulated financial undertakings in the Union that issue ESG ratings and incorporate those ratings in the financial products or services that they offer to third parties should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nNon-profit organisations that issue ESG ratings for non-commercial purposes and that publish those ratings free of charge should not be deemed to fall within the scope of this Regulation. However, they should endeavour to integrate the transparency requirements laid down in this Regulation where applicable. Where non-profit organisations charge rated items and issuers of rated items to report data or to get rated through their platform, or where they charge users of ESG ratings to access any information on ESG ratings, they should be subject to the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nNatural persons, including academics and journalists, who publish and distribute ESG ratings for non-commercial purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nTo assess the ESG profile of companies, and as part of their sustainable investment and financing decision-making processes, credit institutions, investment firms, insurance undertakings and reinsurance undertakings, amongst others, rely both on external ESG ratings and on external ESG data products. Financial institutions should bear responsibility in the event of greenwashing accusations concerning their financial products, while the sole distribution of ESG information on entities or financial products, relying on proprietary or established methodology, which includes, among others, datasets on emissions and data on ESG controversies, should not be covered by this Regulation. The Commission should carry out a review of this Regulation to assess whether the scope identified is sufficient to ensure the confidence of investors and consumers in the sustainability performance of financial products and services. The Commission should envisage, where needed, broadening the set of ESG data products and ESG data product providers covered by this Regulation.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nIt is important to lay down rules ensuring that ESG ratings provided by ESG rating providers authorised in the Union are of adequate quality, are subject to appropriate requirements that recognise the existence of different business models, and ensure market integrity. Those rules would apply to overall ESG ratings capturing environmental, social and governance factors, and to ratings that only assess a single environmental, social or governance factor or a sub-component of such a factor. Separate environmental (E), social (S) and governance (G) ratings should be provided rather than a single ESG rating that aggregates E, S and G factors. If ESG rating providers decide to provide aggregated ratings, they should disclose the rate and weight granted to each E, S and G category and present that information in a manner that ensures that each of those categories can be compared with the others.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nGiven the use of ESG ratings from providers established outside the Union, and in order to ensure market integrity, investor protection and proper enforcement of this Regulation, it is necessary to introduce requirements based on which ESG rating providers established outside the Union may offer their services in the Union. Therefore, three possible regimes are proposed for ESG rating providers established outside the Union: equivalence, endorsement and recognition. As a rule, supervision and regulation in a third country should be equivalent to Union supervision and regulation of ESG ratings. Therefore, ESG ratings provided by an ESG rating provider established outside the Union and authorised or registered as such in a third country should only be offered in the Union where a positive decision on equivalence of the third-country regime has been taken by the Commission. However, to avoid any adverse impact resulting from a possible abrupt cessation of the offering in the Union of ESG ratings provided by an ESG rating provider established outside the Union, it is necessary to provide for certain other regimes, namely of endorsement and recognition. Any ESG rating provider with a group structure should be able to use the endorsement regime for ESG ratings developed outside the Union. To do so, it should establish, within the group structure, an authorised ESG rating provider in the Union. That authorised ESG rating provider should ensure that the issuance and distribution of endorsed ESG ratings fulfils requirements which are at least as stringent as the requirements of this Regulation. Additionally, the ESG rating provider established in the Union should possess the necessary expertise to effectively monitor the issuance and distribution of ESG ratings provided by the ESG rating provider established outside the Union and there should be an objective reason why the endorsed ratings are issued by a provider established outside the Union. The requirement to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation should not be proven for each individual endorsed ESG rating but rather for the overall methodologies and procedures implemented by the ESG rating provider. For their part, ESG rating providers that are categorised as small undertakings or small groups according to the criteria laid down in Directive 2013/34/EU (‘small ESG rating providers’) should be able to benefit from the recognition regime. Where an ESG provider established outside the Union is subject to supervision in a third country, appropriate cooperation arrangements should be put in place in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information with the relevant third-country competent authority.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nThe notion of establishment extends to any real and effective activity exercised through stable arrangements. When determining whether an entity based outside the Union has an establishment in a Member State, it is pertinent to consider the degree of stability of those arrangements, the effective exercise of activities in the Union, and the specific nature of the economic activities and services provided.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nThe Union represents one of the main markets for ESG ratings. It is also one of the first jurisdictions to regulate the transparency and integrity of ESG ratings. The Commission should continue to work with international partners to foster convergence of the rules applying to ESG rating providers.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure a high level of investor and consumer confidence in the internal market, ESG rating providers which provide ESG ratings in the Union should be required to be authorised. It is therefore necessary to lay down harmonised conditions for such authorisation and the procedure for granting or refusing and suspending or withdrawing such authorisation. Authorised ESG rating providers should notify ESMA of any material changes to the conditions for their initial authorisation without undue delay. Material changes include any opening or closing of a branch within the Union. In order to provide more clarity to ESG rating providers, ESMA should specify what constitutes a material change by issuing guidelines to that effect.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure a high level of information to investors and other users of ESG ratings, information on ESG ratings and ESG rating providers should be made available on the European single access point (ESAP) established by Regulation (EU) 2023/2859 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure the quality and reliability of ESG ratings, ESG rating providers should use rating methodologies that are rigorous, systematic, independent, continuous and capable of justification and that apply continuously and in a transparent manner. ESG rating providers should be encouraged to address both aspects of the double materiality principle. ESG rating providers should review ESG rating methodologies on an ongoing basis and at least annually, taking into account Union and international developments affecting the E, S or G factors. However, it is important to leave it to the ESG rating providers themselves to determine their own methodologies in accordance with those principles.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nESG rating providers should disclose information to the public on the methodologies, models and key rating assumptions which those providers use in their ESG rating activities and in each of their ESG rating products. In light of the uses of ESG ratings by investors, rating products should clearly disclose which dimension of the double materiality principle the rating addresses, namely, whether it is both the material financial risk to the rated item or the issuer of the rated item and the material impact of the rated item or the issuer of the rated item on the environment and society in general, or whether it addresses only one of those matters. ESG rating providers should also clearly disclose whether the rating addresses other dimensions. For the same reason, ESG rating providers should provide more detailed information on the methodologies, models and key rating assumptions to users of ESG ratings. That information should enable users of ESG ratings to perform their own due diligence when assessing whether to rely on those ESG ratings. Disclosure of information concerning methodologies, models and key rating assumptions should however not reveal sensitive business information or impede innovation. ESG rating providers should also disclose whether they have taken into account E, S or G factors, or an aggregation thereof, the rating given to each relevant factor, and the weighting each of those factors is given in the aggregation. ESG rating providers should also disclose the limitations of the information available to them and the limitations of the methodology used, such as when they assess only one of the two dimensions of the double materiality principle or when the ESG rating is expressed in absolute or relative value. They should also disclose information about any possible engagement with stakeholders of the rated item or issuer of the rated item.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure a sufficient level of quality, it is recommended that ESG ratings take into account Union objectives and international standards for each factor. As such, ESG rating providers should provide information on whether the ESG rating takes into account, amongst others, the targets and objectives of relevant international agreements, including those of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement’) approved by the Union on 5 October 2016 (11) for the E factor, compliance with the International Labour Organisation’s core conventions on the right to organise and collective bargaining for the S factor, and alignment with international standards on tax evasion and avoidance for the G factor.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) represent landmark legislative initiatives to enhance the availability, quality and consistency of ESG requirements across the entire value chain of financial market participants, which contribute to improving the quality of ESG ratings.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation should not interfere with ESG rating methodologies or the content of ESG ratings. Diversity in the methodologies of ESG rating providers ensures that the broad requirements of users of ESG ratings can be met and promotes competition in the market.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nWhilst an ESG rating provider should be permitted to use alignment with the taxonomy set out in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as a relevant factor or key performance indicator in its rating methodology, ESG ratings within the scope of this Regulation should not be considered ESG labels indicating or providing assurances of compliance or alignment with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 or with any other standards.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nESG rating providers should ensure that they provide ESG ratings that are independent, impartial, systematic and of adequate quality. It is important to introduce organisational requirements ensuring the prevention and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest. To ensure their independence, ESG rating providers should avoid situations of conflict of interest and manage such conflicts adequately where they are unavoidable. ESG rating providers should disclose conflicts of interest in a timely manner. They should also keep records of all significant threats to their independence and that of their employees and other persons involved in the rating process, and of the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats. In addition, to avoid potential conflicts of interest, ESG rating providers should not be allowed to offer from within the same entity a number of other activities including consulting services, credit ratings, benchmarks, investment activities, auditing, activities of credit institutions or insurance and reinsurance activities. Finally, to prevent, identify, eliminate or manage and disclose any conflicts of interest and ensure at all times the quality, integrity and thoroughness of the ESG rating and review process, ESG rating providers should establish appropriate internal policies and procedures in relation to employees and other persons involved in the rating process. Such policies and procedures should, in particular, include internal control mechanisms and an oversight function.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to address the risks of conflicts of interest, some activities should be offered from separate legal entities. However, some of those activities could be offered from within the same legal entity where the ESG rating provider concerned has sufficient measures and procedures in place to ensure that each activity is exercised autonomously and to avoid creating potential risks of conflicts of interest in decision-making within its ESG rating activities. Such derogation should not be possible for credit rating activities and for auditing and consulting activities. Consulting activities include developing sustainability strategies and strategies to manage sustainability risks or impacts. With respect to the activity of the provision of benchmarks, ESMA should assess whether the measures proposed by the ESG rating provider are appropriate and sufficient regarding the potential risks of conflict of interest. Such an assessment should take into account whether the benchmark administrator offers benchmarks that pursue sustainability objectives and in particular EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nESG rating providers should ensure that their employees and other persons involved in the rating process do not participate in, or otherwise influence, the determination of an ESG rating of any rated item if there is any evidence of self-review, self-interest, advocacy or familiarity stemming from financial, personal, business, employment or other relationships between those persons and the rated item or the issuer of a rated item as a result of which an objective, reasonable and informed third party, taking into account the safeguards applied, would conclude that those persons’ independence is compromised. If, during the period in which employees of ESG rating providers or other persons involved in the rating process are part of the assessment activities, a rated item or an issuer of a rated item merges with, or acquires, another entity, those persons should identify and evaluate any current or recent interests or relationships which, taking into account available safeguards, could compromise those persons’ independence and ability to continue being involved in the assessment activities after the effective date of the merger or acquisition.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nTo bring more clarity to, and enhance trust regarding, the operations of ESG rating providers, it is necessary to lay down requirements for the ongoing supervision of ESG rating providers in the Union. In light of the significant similarities between the activities of credit rating agencies and those of ESG rating providers, the related close alignment of central aspects of the regulatory framework for ESG rating providers to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), and in order to ensure a harmonised application of this Regulation as well as uniform supervision, it is deemed advisable, considering the decision taken under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 to entrust supervision to ESMA, to entrust the supervision of ESG rating providers to ESMA. The fact that this Regulation entrusts supervision to ESMA does not constitute a precedent and should not be interpreted as establishing a practice or policy on the attribution of supervisory responsibilities in the financial services sector.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nAside from their use in the financial services sector, ESG ratings are also used in the procurement and supply chain context. Therefore, in its supervision of ESG rating providers, ESMA should take account of the distinction between ESG rating providers in financial services sectors and those in non-financial services sectors.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nESMA should be able to require all information necessary to carry out its supervisory tasks effectively. It should therefore be able to demand such information from ESG rating providers, persons involved in ESG rating activities, rated items and issuers of rated items, third parties to whom ESG rating providers have outsourced operational functions or activities, persons otherwise closely and substantially related or connected to ESG rating providers or ESG rating activities, and legal representatives designated under the recognition regime.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nESMA should be able to perform its supervisory tasks, and in particular to compel ESG rating providers to bring an end to an infringement, to supply complete and correct information, or to submit to an investigation or an on-site inspection. To ensure that it is able to perform those supervisory tasks, ESMA should be able to impose fines and periodic penalty payments.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nGiven its role as the Union authority that authorises and supervises ESG rating providers, ESMA should develop draft regulatory technical standards and submit them to the Commission. ESMA should specify further the information needed for the authorisation of ESG rating providers. The Commission should be empowered to adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nWhen authorising and supervising ESG rating providers, ESMA should be able to charge supervised entities supervisory fees. Such fees should be proportionate and appropriate to the size of the ESG rating providers and to the extent of their supervision.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to specify further technical elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specifications of the procedure to impose fines or periodic penalty payments, including provisions on rights of defence, temporal provisions, provisions on the collection of fines or periodic penalty payments, and detailed rules on the limitation periods for the imposition and enforcement of fines or periodic penalty payments, and in respect of the type of fees, the matters for which fees are due, the amount of the fees, and the manner in which those fees are to be paid. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (16). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nIt is necessary to have in place a number of measures supporting small ESG rating providers to enable them to continue their activities, or to enter the market after the date of application of this Regulation. Against that background, a temporary regime should be introduced to facilitate the market entry of small ESG rating providers and support the development of existing small ESG rating providers already operating in the Union before the entry into force of this Regulation. Under that temporary regime, small ESG rating providers should register with ESMA, without the need to obtain authorisation to operate in the Union, and should only be subject to the provisions of this Regulation regarding organisational and transparency requirements. ESMA should be empowered to request information and to conduct general investigations and on-site inspections, as well as to adopt administrative measures. ESMA should ensure that risks of circumvention of this Regulation are avoided, particularly by preventing small undertakings within medium-sized or large groups according to the criteria laid down in Directive 2013/34/EU from benefitting from the temporary regime. Once the temporary regime comes to an end, small ESG rating providers should apply for authorisation to operate in the Union and benefit from proportionate governance requirements and supervisory fees proportionate to the annual net turnover of the ESG rating provider concerned.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nWhere an item, issuer of an item or an investor seeks an ESG rating from at least two ESG rating providers, it may consider appointing at least one ESG rating provider with a market share for ESG rating activities of no more than 10 % in the Union.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely, to lay down a consistent and effective regime to address the shortcomings and vulnerabilities posed by ESG ratings, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reasons of the scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nThis Regulation applies without prejudice to the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nThe European Central Bank delivered its own initiative opinion on 4 October 2023,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nTITLE I\n\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter\n\nThis Regulation introduces a common regulatory approach to enhance the integrity, transparency, comparability where possible, responsibility, reliability, good governance and independence of ESG rating activities, thereby contributing to the transparency and quality of ESG ratings and to the sustainable finance agenda of the Union. It aims to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, while achieving a high level of consumer and investor protection and preventing greenwashing and other types of misinformation, including social washing, by introducing transparency requirements related to ESG ratings and rules on the organisation and conduct of ESG rating providers.\n\nArticle 2\n\nScope\n\n1.   This Regulation applies to ESG ratings issued by ESG rating providers operating in the Union.\n\nESG rating providers are considered to be operating in the Union in the following cases:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nfor ESG rating providers established in the Union:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nwhen they issue and publish their ESG ratings on their website or through other means; or\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nwhen they issue and distribute their ESG ratings by subscription or other contractual relationships to regulated financial undertakings in the Union, to undertakings that fall within the scope of Directive 2013/34/EU, to undertakings that fall within the scope of Directive 2004/109/EC, or to Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or Member State public authorities;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nfor ESG rating providers established outside the Union, when they issue and distribute their ESG ratings by subscription or other contractual relationships to regulated financial undertakings in the Union, to undertakings that fall within the scope of Directive 2013/34/EU, to undertakings that fall within the scope of Directive 2004/109/EC, or to Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or Member State public authorities.\n\n2.   This Regulation does not apply to any of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\nprivate ESG ratings that are not intended for public disclosure or for distribution;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nESG ratings issued by regulated financial undertakings in the Union that are used exclusively for internal purposes or for providing in-house or intragroup financial services or products;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\nESG ratings issued by regulated financial undertakings in the Union that:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nare incorporated in a product or a service, where such products or services are already regulated under Union law, including under Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, Directives 2013/36/EU (18), 2014/65/EU, 2009/138/EC (19), 2009/65/EC (20), 2011/61/EU (21) and (EU) 2016/2341 (22) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulations (EU) 2020/1503 (23), (EU) 2023/1114 (24) and (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council; and\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nare disclosed to a third party.\n\nIn the situations covered by the first subparagraph of this point, where a regulated financial undertaking in the Union discloses an ESG rating to third parties as part of its marketing communications, it shall include on its website the same information as that required by point 1 of Annex III to this Regulation and it shall disclose in those marketing communications a link to those website disclosures, except where it is subject to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.\n\nCompetent authorities designated in accordance with the sectoral legislative acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this point shall monitor compliance by regulated financial undertakings in the Union with the requirements of the first subparagraph of this point, in accordance with the powers granted by those sectoral legislative acts;\n\n(d)\n\n\t\n\nESG ratings issued by ESG rating providers established outside the Union that are not authorised or recognised under Title II and that meet the following conditions:\n\n(i)\n\n\t\n\nthe ESG rating is distributed at the own exclusive initiative of the user of the ESG rating established in the Union without any prior contact, solicitation, promotion, advertisement or any other initiative by the ESG rating provider, or by any third party on behalf of the provider; an ESG rating distributed in the Union by a provider established outside the Union whose market share in the Union for its ESG rating activities becomes substantial or that has a website in at least one of the official languages of the Union, which is a language that is not customary in the sphere of international finance, shall not be considered to be distributed at the own exclusive initiative of the user of ESG rating.\n\nThe own exclusive initiative of a user of ESG rating as referred to in the first subparagraph of this point shall not entitle an ESG rating provider established outside the Union to distribute ESG ratings to that user in a recurrent manner, nor to distribute ESG ratings to any other user of ESG ratings in the Union;\n\n(ii)\n\n\t\n\nthere is no

ESMA shall notify the applicant of that decision within five working days.\n\n4.   An endorsed ESG rating shall be considered to be an ESG rating provided by the endorsing ESG rating provider. The endorsing ESG rating provider shall not use the endorsement to avoid or circumvent the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n5.   An endorsing ESG rating provider shall remain fully responsible for the endorsed ESG ratings and for compliance with the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n6.   Where ESMA has well-founded reasons to consider that the conditions laid down in this Article are no longer fulfilled, it shall have the power to require the endorsing ESG rating provider to cease the endorsement, without prejudice to the imposition of any applicable supervisory measures, fines and periodic penalty payments in accordance with Articles 35, 36 and 37.\n\nArticle 12\n\nRecognition of ESG rating providers established outside the Union\n\n1.   Until such time as the Commission has adopted an equivalence decision as referred to in Article 10 or, where adopted, in the event that the equivalence decision is repealed, an ESG rating provider established outside the Union with an annual net turnover of all of its activities that is below the maximum amount set in Article 3(2), second subparagraph, of Directive 2013/34/EU, for each of the last three consecutive years may operate in the Union provided that ESMA has recognised that ESG rating provider in accordance with this Article.

To that end, ESMA may take into account either an assessment by an independent external auditor or a certification of the competent authority of the third country where the ESG rating provider is established.\n\n2.   ESG rating providers established outside the Union that wish to be recognised as referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and submit an application for recognition to ESMA.\n\n3.   An ESG rating provider established outside the Union that wishes to be recognised as referred to in paragraph 1 shall have a legal representative. That legal representative shall be a legal person established in the Union and expressly appointed by the ESG rating provider to act on its behalf.

The decision shall specify the subject matter and purpose of the investigation, the periodic penalty payments provided for in Article 37 of this Regulation, the legal remedies available under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and the right to have the decision reviewed by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n4.   In good time before the investigation, ESMA shall inform the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory that investigation is to be carried out of the investigation and of the identity of the persons authorised by ESMA for the purposes of the investigation. Officials of the competent authority concerned shall, upon the request of ESMA, assist those authorised persons in carrying out their duties. Officials of the competent authority concerned may also attend the investigation upon request.\n\n5.   If a request for records of telephone or data traffic referred to in paragraph 1, point (e), requires authorisation from a judicial authority according to national rules, such authorisation shall be applied for. Such authorisation may also be applied for as a precautionary measure.\n\n6.   Where an authorisation as referred to in paragraph 5 is applied for, the national judicial authority shall verify that the decision of ESMA is authentic and that the coercive measures envisaged are neither arbitrary nor excessive having regard to the subject matter of the investigation. When verifying the proportionality of the coercive measures, the national judicial authority may ask ESMA for detailed explanations, in particular relating to the grounds ESMA has for suspecting that an infringement of this Regulation has taken place, the seriousness of the suspected infringement and the nature of the involvement of the person subject to the coercive measures. However, the national judicial authority shall not review the necessity for the investigation or demand that it be provided with the information on ESMA’s file. The lawfulness of ESMA’s decision shall be subject to review only by the Court of Justice of the European Union following the procedure set out in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\nArticle 34\n\nOn-site inspections\n\n1.   In order to carry out its duties under this Regulation, ESMA may conduct all necessary on-site inspections at the business premises of the legal persons referred to in Article 32(1).

The decision shall specify the subject matter and purpose of the inspection, the date on which it is to begin, the periodic penalty payments provided for in Article 37 of this Regulation, the legal remedies available under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and the right to have the decision reviewed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. ESMA shall take such decisions after consulting the competent authority of the Member State where the inspection is to be conducted.\n\n5.   Officials and other persons authorised or appointed by the competent authority of the Member State where the inspection is to be conducted shall, upon the request of ESMA, actively assist the officials and other persons authorised by ESMA. To that end, they shall enjoy the powers set out in paragraph 2. Officials of the competent authority of the Member State concerned may also attend the on-site inspections upon request.\n\n6.   ESMA may also require the competent authorities to carry out specific investigatory tasks and on-site inspections on its behalf, as provided for in this Article and in Article 33(1). To that end, the competent authorities shall enjoy the same powers as ESMA as set out in this Article and in Article 33(1).\n\n7.   Where the officials and other persons authorised by ESMA find that a person opposes an inspection ordered pursuant to this Article, the competent authority of the Member State concerned shall afford them the necessary assistance, requesting, where appropriate, the assistance of the police or of an equivalent enforcement authority, so as to enable them to conduct their on-site inspection.\n\n8.   If the on-site inspection provided for in paragraph 1 or the assistance provided for in paragraph 7 requires authorisation by a judicial authority according to national rules, such authorisation shall be applied for. Such authorisation may also be applied for as a precautionary measure.\n\n9.   Where an authorisation as referred to in paragraph 8 is applied for, the national judicial authority shall verify that the decision of ESMA is authentic and that the coercive measures envisaged are neither arbitrary nor excessive having regard to the subject matter of the inspection. When verifying the proportionality of the coercive measures, the national judicial authority may ask ESMA for detailed explanations, in particular relating to the grounds ESMA has for suspecting that an infringement of this Regulation has taken place, the seriousness of the suspected infringement and the nature of the involvement of the person subject to the coercive measures. However, the national judicial authority shall not review the necessity for the inspection or demand to be provided with the information on ESMA’s file.

ESMA shall publish any such decision on its website within 10 working days of the date when it was adopted.\n\nThe publication referred to in the first subparagraph shall contain all of the following:\n\n(a)\n\n\t\n\na statement affirming the right of the ESG rating provider to appeal the decision;\n\n(b)\n\n\t\n\nwhere relevant, a statement affirming that an appeal has been lodged and specifying that such an appeal does not have suspensive effect;\n\n(c)\n\n\t\n\na statement asserting that it is possible for ESMA to suspend the application of the contested decision in accordance with Article 60(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n7.   ESMA may also require the infringing ESG rating provider to inform the users of its ESG ratings of any supervisory measure taken by ESMA pursuant to paragraph 1.\n\nArticle 36\n\nFines\n\n1.   Where ESMA finds that an ESG rating provider, or, where applicable, its legal representative, has, intentionally or negligently, infringed this Regulation, it shall adopt a decision imposing a fine.

It shall be calculated from the date stipulated in the decision imposing the periodic penalty payment.\n\n4.   A periodic penalty payment shall be imposed for a maximum period of six months following notification of ESMA’s decision referred to in paragraph 1. Following the end of the period for which the periodic penalty payment is imposed, ESMA shall review the measure.\n\nArticle 38\n\nDisclosure, nature, enforcement and allocation of fines and periodic penalty payments\n\n1.   ESMA shall disclose to the public every fine and every periodic penalty payment that it has imposed pursuant to Articles 36 and 37 of this Regulation, unless such disclosure would seriously jeopardise Union financial markets or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved.

ESMA shall refrain from imposing fines or periodic penalty payments where a prior acquittal or conviction arising from an identical fact or facts which are substantially the same has already acquired the force of res judicata as the result of criminal proceedings under national law.\n\nArticle 40\n\nHearing of persons subject to investigations\n\n1.   Before taking any decision imposing a supervisory measure, fine or periodic penalty payment pursuant to Article 35, 36 or 37, ESMA shall give the persons subject to the investigations the opportunity to be heard on its findings. ESMA shall base its decisions only on findings on which the persons subject to the investigations have had an opportunity to comment.\n\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply where urgent action pursuant to Article 35 is needed to prevent significant and imminent damage to the financial system.

    "texte": "DIRECTIVE (EU) 2024/3019 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\nof 27 November 2024\n\nconcerning urban wastewater treatment\n\n(recast)\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nCouncil Directive 91/271/EEC (4) has been substantially amended several times (5). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n\n(2)\n\n\t\n\nWater is a primary good which belongs to everyone and is for everyone. As a natural resource which is essential, irreplaceable and indispensable to life, it needs to be considered and integrated in its three dimensions: social, economic and environmental.\n\n(3)\n\n\t\n\nDirective 91/271/EEC sets the legal framework for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban wastewater and the discharge of biodegradable wastewater from certain industrial sectors. Urban wastewater can be formed by different mixtures of domestic wastewater, urban runoff and non-domestic wastewater from other origins. Wastewater from institutions such as offices, schools, kitchens with food preparation which originates predominantly from the human metabolism qualifies as domestic wastewater. The objective of Directive 91/271/EEC is to protect the environment from being adversely affected by insufficiently treated urban wastewater discharges. It has contributed to achieving the objectives established under Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and other relevant Union law. This Directive should continue to pursue the same objective while also contributing to the protection of public health in accordance with the One Health approach, which is aimed at sustainably balancing and optimising the health of people, animals and ecosystems, when for instance urban wastewater is discharged into bathing waters or into water bodies used for the abstraction of drinking water, or when urban wastewater is used as an indicator for parameters relevant for public health. It should also ensure access to sanitation and to key information related to the governance of urban wastewater collection and treatment activities. This Directive should also aim at increasing synergies with climate change adaptation and actions to restore urban ecosystems in particular through integrated urban wastewater management planning, while making optimal use of digitalisation. Finally, this Directive should contribute to the progressive reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from urban wastewater collection and treatment activities, in particular by further reducing nitrogen emissions but also by promoting energy efficiency and production of renewable energies, and thus should contribute to the 2050 objective of Climate Neutrality established under Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). In line with Article 193 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States can go beyond the minimum requirements set out in this Directive. Member States could consider for instance applying deadlines or thresholds more stringent than those included in this Directive, reaching energy or climate neutrality more rapidly or imposing additional requirements for, or broadening the spectrum of the application of, their national extended producer responsibility systems.\n\n(4)\n\n\t\n\nIn 2019, the Commission performed an evaluation of Directive 91/271/EEC under the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (the ‘evaluation’). It became apparent from that exercise that certain provisions of that Directive needed to be updated. Three important sources of pollution not fully addressed under that Directive from urban wastewater that could be avoided were identified, namely storm water overflows and polluted discharges of urban runoff, potentially malfunctioning individual systems, that is to say systems treating domestic wastewater that does not enter collecting systems, and small agglomerations that are currently not completely covered by Directive 91/271/EEC. Those three sources of pollution put significant pressure on surface water bodies in the Union. Moreover, the report of the evaluation also highlighted the need to improve the transparency and governance of urban wastewater activities, to seize the opportunity offered by the urban wastewater treatment sector to use its potential for renewable energy development and make tangible steps towards energy neutrality as a contribution to climate neutrality, and to harmonise urban wastewater surveillance of health parameters, such as the COVID-19 virus and its variants, as a means of supporting public health action.\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nAccording to the 2018 report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) on European waters, small agglomerations put significant pressure on 11 % of the surface water bodies in the Union. To better tackle the pollution from such agglomerations, and to prevent discharges of untreated urban wastewater into the environment, the scope of this Directive should include all agglomerations of 1 000 population equivalent (p.e.) and above.\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the effective treatment of urban wastewater before discharge into the environment, all urban wastewater from agglomerations of 1 000 p.e. and above should be collected in collecting systems, unless Member States justify the need for a derogation for the use of individual systems under this Directive. When delineating their agglomerations, Member States should take into account the indicative reference threshold of 10 to 25 p.e. per hectare, above which the population, possibly combined with economic activities, located in a specific area is considered sufficiently concentrated. Where collecting systems are already in place, Member States should ensure that all sources of domestic wastewater are connected to them.\n\n(7)\n\n\t\n\nSignificant investments will be necessary to implement the new requirements introduced by this Directive. It is therefore necessary to take into account the specific situation of each Member State and, where appropriate, adapt the deadlines for the implementation of certain demanding requirements. For instance, Member States having a large number of small agglomerations concerned by the new requirements of this Directive in terms of collection and treatment of urban wastewater for agglomerations of between 1 000 and 2 000 p.e., should be allowed to extend the deadlines for compliance with those new requirements in their first national implementation programme. This should also be the case for Member States having a large number of facilities, for example above 50 %, that need to be upgraded to tertiary treatment in line with the new requirements of this Directive. Agglomerations of below 2 000 p.e. where collecting systems are already in place and discharging urban wastewater into treatment plants located in a different agglomeration should not be counted in the calculation of percentages for the purposes of the derogations from those deadlines. Moreover, the three Member States that acceded to the Union most recently, namely Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, had to make recent investments to implement the requirements of Directive 91/271/EEC. Furthermore, those Member States are characterised by high amounts of rural areas with a high outflux of population, in addition to an ageing rural population. It is therefore necessary to take into account the specific situation of those Member States by allowing them to extend the deadlines for compliance with those new requirements in their first national implementation programme.\n\n(8)\n\n\t\n\nWhere archaeologically valuable sites are encountered during infrastructural works, such as the building of collecting systems or urban wastewater treatment plants, such works are often delayed due to the need to perform archaeological studies on the site in accordance with national law. It is therefore appropriate to adapt the implementation deadlines in those specific cases. More specifically, where a Member State establishes that, due to the necessity to preserve cultural heritage, the construction of the required infrastructure is particularly difficult, it should be allowed to adapt the implementation deadlines in specific areas, and update accordingly its national implementation programme. The extensions of the deadlines should be set for each area and kept as short as possible, not exceeding 8 years. Cultural heritage should be understood within the meaning of Article 1 of the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention.\n\n(9)\n\n\t\n\nWhere it can be demonstrated that the establishment of an urban wastewater collecting system or the connection to a collecting system would produce no benefit for the environment or human health, would not be technically feasible or would involve excessive costs, and only in those cases, Member States should be allowed to use individual systems to collect, store and/or treat urban wastewater, provided that they ensure the same level of protection of the environment and human health as secondary and tertiary treatment. Individual systems can include different types of collection, storage or treatment system, such as nature-based solutions, small-sized treatment systems, or temporary tanks combined with regular evacuation to treatment plants. Member States should also exchange best practices on the use and operation of individual systems.\n\n(10)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should establish national, regional or local registers to identify individual systems and temporary storage used on their territory and take all measures necessary to ensure that the design of such systems is adequate, that the systems are properly maintained and that they are subject to a regular compliance control on the basis of a risk-based approach. In particular, Member States should ensure that individual systems used for the collection, storage or treatment of urban wastewater are impervious and leak-proof, and that monitoring and inspection of the systems are carried out at regular and fixed intervals. Taking into account the disproportionate costs for adapting the design of such systems to the new design requirements, those new design requirements should not apply to systems established prior to the entry into force of this Directive. Where individual systems are used to collect and/or treat more than 2 % of the urban wastewater load at national level from agglomerations of 2 000 p.e. and above, Member States should provide the Commission with justifications for the use of individual systems instead of collecting systems, demonstrating compliance of those systems with established standards under this Directive and describing the measures taken to reduce the use of such systems.\n\n(11)\n\n\t\n\nAs a result of precipitation, such as rain, snow or meltwater, storm water overflows and urban runoff represent a sizeable remaining source of pollution discharged into the environment. Such overflows and runoff are expected to increase due to the combined effects of urbanisation and the progressive change of the rain regime linked with climate change. Urban wastewater management infrastructure is therefore particularly vulnerable to climate change. Solutions to reduce that source of pollution should be defined at local level, taking into account the specific local conditions. They should be based on an integrated quantitative and qualitative water management in urban areas. Therefore, Member States should ensure that integrated urban wastewater management plans are established at local level for all agglomerations of 100 000 p.e. and above as those agglomerations are responsible for a significant share of the pollution emitted. Furthermore, integrated urban wastewater management plans should also be put in place for agglomerations of between 10 000 p.e. and 100 000 p.e. where storm water overflows or urban runoff pose a risk for the environment or public health. In those plans, measures should be set out that aim at limiting the pollution from storm water overflows to no more than 2 % of the annual collected urban wastewater load calculated in dry weather flow conditions calculated on the basis of the pollutants in Tables 1 and 2 in Annex I.\n\n(12)\n\n\t\n\nThose plans should include measures to reduce the pollution from storm water overflows and also address the potentially significant pollution coming from separately collected urban runoff, for instance the pollution resulting from first rains after long dry periods in densely populated areas. Those plans should also include measures to prevent pollution at source and favour nature-based solutions over those that would require the establishment of grey infrastructure. Those measures could include preventive temporary measures aimed at avoiding the entry of unpolluted rain waters into collecting systems or temporary storage, including natural water retention, and appropriate treatment of heavily loaded runoff or overflows resulting from first rains. Member States are encouraged to increase green and blue spaces in urban areas and to take into account the Urban Nature platform, which provides guidance and knowledge to support towns and cities. In order to ensure adequate coverage of the integrated urban wastewater management plans and a comprehensive solution to storm water problems, those plans should be established for drainage areas of the agglomerations concerned.\n\n(13)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure that the integrated urban wastewater management plans are cost-effective, it is important that they be based on best practices that have already been applied in urban areas. Therefore, the measures to be considered should be based on a thorough analysis of the local conditions and should favour a preventive approach aimed at limiting the collection of unpolluted rain waters and optimising the use of existing infrastructure to generate energy savings and contribute to emission reduction. With a preference for green and blue developments and investments, new grey infrastructure should be envisaged only where absolutely necessary.\n\n(14)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to protect the environment, in particular the coastal and marine environment, including the protection of surface, ground and drinking water, and public health from being adversely affected by the discharge of insufficiently treated urban wastewater, secondary treatment should be applied to all discharges of urban wastewater from agglomerations of 1 000 p.e. and above. Due to the expansion of the scope of this Directive to include smaller agglomerations, Member States should be given sufficient time to establish the required infrastructure to meet the obligations set out in this Directive. Similarly, enough time should be given to Member States to adapt their treatment infrastructure for agglomerations discharging their urban wastewater into coastal waters or less sensitive areas where secondary treatment was not required under Directive 91/271/EEC.\n\n(15)\n\n\t\n\nDischarges in high mountain regions, namely regions above an altitude of 1 500 m, and small agglomerations of below 2 000 p.e. in cold climate areas with a quarterly average temperature of below 6 oC in the inlet, in which it is difficult to apply an effective biological treatment because of low temperatures, should be allowed to use treatment less stringent than secondary treatment, provided that detailed studies demonstrate that such discharges do not have adverse effects on the environment or human health. Similarly, discharges into deep marine waters from smaller agglomerations of below 150 000 p.e. located in less-populated outermost regions, with fewer than 275 000 inhabitants characterised by difficult topography, such as steep slopes, and discharging their urban wastewater into deep marine waters in the open ocean, favouring a high level of dilution of those urban wastewater discharges into the receiving waters, should also be able to benefit from that derogation. Nevertheless, in order to ensure the equal treatment of all Member States and a high level of protection of the environment and human health on the whole territory of the Union, that derogation should be limited to 20 years, which is the time required to progressively upgrade the remaining urban wastewater treatment plants to secondary treatment in those areas where secondary treatment might be more difficult to apply. That derogation should be granted provided that detailed studies demonstrate that such discharges do not have adverse effects on the environment or human health and do not impact the compliance of the receiving waters with other relevant Union law, such as Directive 2000/60/EC, 2006/7/EC (8), or 2008/56/EC (9) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n(16)\n\n\t\n\nThe evaluation showed that significant reductions of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions were achieved through the implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC. Nevertheless, urban wastewater treatment plants remain, according to the evaluation, an important pathway of those pollutants into the environment, directly leading to eutrophication of water bodies and seas in the Union. Part of this pollution can be avoided as technical progress and best practices in place show that emission limit values established under Directive 91/271/EEC for nitrogen and phosphorus are outdated and should be strengthened, especially for larger treatment plants. Tertiary treatment should be systematically imposed on all urban wastewater treatment plants of 150 000 p.e. and above, as such plants represent an important remaining source of nitrogen and phosphorus discharge.\n\n(17)\n\n\t\n\nTertiary treatment should also be mandatory in agglomerations of 10 000 p.e. and above that are discharging into areas subject to, or at risk of, eutrophication. In order to ensure that efforts to limit eutrophication are coordinated at the level of the relevant basins for the whole catchment zone, and to ensure the consistent designation of sensitive areas across the Union, areas where eutrophication is considered an issue according to currently available data should be listed in this Directive. Additionally, in order to ensure the coherence of relevant Union law, Member States should identify other areas subject to, or at risk of, eutrophication on their territory, and identify whether those areas are nitrogen- or phosphorus-sensitive, or both nitrogen- and phosphorus-sensitive in particular on the basis of data collected under Council Directive 91/676/EEC (10), Directive 2000/60/EC and Directive 2008/56/EC. The reinforcement of the limit values, the more coherent and inclusive identification of the areas sensitive to eutrophication and the obligation to ensure tertiary treatment for all large facilities would, in combination, contribute to limit eutrophication. Since this will require additional investment at national level, Member States should be given sufficient time to establish the required infrastructure.\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\nRecent scientific knowledge underpinning several Commission strategies, as set out in four communications from the Commission, namely that of 16 January 2018 entitled ‘A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy’, that of 11 March 2019 entitled ‘European Union Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment’, that of 14 October 2020 entitled ‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability – Towards a Toxic-Free Environment’ and that of 12 May 2021 entitled ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All – EU Action Plan: “Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil”’, highlights the need to take action to address the issue of micropollutants, which are now routinely detected in all waters in the Union. Some of those micropollutants are hazardous for public health and the environment even in low concentrations, of micrograms per litre or below. While the primary, secondary and tertiary treatment already remove some micropollutants, an additional treatment, i.e. quaternary treatment, should be introduced in order to ensure that a large spectrum of the remaining micropollutants are removed from urban wastewater. Quaternary treatment should first focus on organic micropollutants, which represent a significant part of the pollution and for which removal technologies have already been designed. The quaternary treatment should be imposed on the basis of the precautionary principle, in combination with a risk-based approach. Therefore, all urban wastewater treatment plants of 150 000 p.e. and above should provide quaternary treatment, as those facilities represent a significant share of micropollutant discharges in the environment and the removal of micropollutants by urban wastewater treatment plants at such scale is cost-effective. For treatment plants of 150 000 p.e. and above, Member States should ensure the prioritisation of the required investments so that the facilities where the risks for the environment and human health are the highest are equipped without delay. For agglomerations of 10 000 p.e. and above, Member States should be required to apply quaternary treatment in areas identified as sensitive to pollution with micropollutants on the basis of clear criteria, which should be specified. Such areas should include locations where the discharge of treated urban wastewater to water bodies results in low dilution ratios, or where the receiving water bodies are used for the production of drinking water, for shellfish production or as bathing waters. Member States should be able not to apply quaternary treatment in those areas when a risk assessment shows that there is no potential danger from micropollutants to the environment or to human health. For all other types of water bodies in agglomerations of 10 000 p.e. and above, Member States should assess the risks that the discharge of micropollutants in urban wastewater poses for the environment or to public health on the basis of a standardised risk assessment and apply quaternary treatment only where needed according to the results of the risk assessment. Where there are several urban wastewater treatment plants in an agglomeration of 10 000 p.e. and above identified as sensitive to pollution with micropollutants, only those discharging into the area at risk should be required to apply quaternary treatment. In order to give Member States enough time to plan and deliver the necessary infrastructure, the requirement of quaternary treatment should progressively apply until 2045 with clear interim objectives.\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the continued compliance of discharges from urban wastewater treatment plants with the requirements for secondary, tertiary and quaternary treatment, samples should be taken in accordance with the requirements of this Directive and those samples should comply with the parametric values that it sets out. In order to take into account possible technical variations in the results from those samples, a maximum permitted number of samples which fail to conform to those parametric values should be laid down.\n\n(20)\n\n\t\n\nThe quaternary treatment necessary to remove micropollutants from urban wastewater will involve additional costs, such as costs related to monitoring and the cost of new advanced equipment to be installed in certain urban wastewater treatment plants. In order to cover those additional costs and in accordance with the polluter-pays principle expressed in Article 191(2) TFEU, it is essential that the producers placing on the Union market products containing substances which, at the end of their life, are found as micropollutants in urban wastewater take responsibility for the additional treatment required to remove those substances, generated in the context of their professional activities. A system of extended producer responsibility is the most appropriate means to achieve this, as it would limit the financial impact on the taxpayer and water tariffs, while providing an incentive to develop greener products. In this context, extended producer responsibility should apply regardless of whether the products are placed on the market, or whether their individual components were manufactured in a Member State or third country, or whether the producers have a registered office in the Union or the product is placed on the market via a digital platform. Pharmaceuticals and cosmetic residues currently represent the main sources of micropollutants found in urban wastewater requiring quaternary treatment. Therefore, extended producer responsibility should apply to those two product groups. On the basis of the results of the urban wastewater monitoring and the most recent scientific data, the Commission should regularly evaluate whether other products should be included in the extended producer responsibility system.\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nAccording to the available data, the potential increase of costs of products or the potential reduction of the profit margins of the industries placing products on the Union market due to the application of extended producer responsibility would be marginal at Union level and would not endanger the affordability, availability or accessibility of those products on the Union market. Member States should, however, take into consideration the possible impacts of the application of the requirements of the extended producer responsibility on the accessibility, availability and affordability of products at national level, in particular medicines, placed on the Union market, as well as the possible impacts of the application of those requirements on the level playing field. Member States can take action to ensure sufficient funds are available, including by financing part of the costs for the quaternary treatment. Given that Member States might choose different implementation approaches, attention should be paid to the functioning of the internal market and, in any forthcoming evaluation of this Directive, the Commission should assess any potential impacts in this regard.\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n\nExemptions from the extended producer responsibility obligations should nevertheless be possible. This should be the case where the total amount of substances contained in products placed on the Union market by a producer amount to small quantities, i.e. less than 1 tonne per year, since the additional administrative burden for the producer would in such cases be disproportionate compared to the environmental benefits. Exemptions should also be possible for the part of the products for which the producer can demonstrate that no micropollutants are generated at the end of life of the product or where it can be proven that the residues from a product are rapidly biodegradable in wastewater and the environment or do not reach the urban wastewater treatment plants. The Commission should establish detailed criteria to identify the products placed on the Union market that do not generate micropollutants in urban wastewater at the end of their life, taking into account their hazardousness and their biodegradability. When developing those criteria, the Commission should take into account criteria already set in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), but also scientific or other available technical information, including relevant international standards. Those criteria should be established before the extended producer responsibility obligations provided for in this Directive enter into force.\n\n(23)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to avoid possible internal market distortions, minimum requirements for the implementation of the extended producer responsibility system should be established in this Directive, while the practical organisation of that system should be decided at national level. In order to favour the substitution of substances and products generating micropollutants residues in urban wastewater, the contributions of the producers should be proportionate to the quantities of the substances contained in the products they place on the market and the hazardousness of those substances and their residues. The contributions should cover, but not exceed, the investment and operational costs for the monitoring activities for micropollutants, the collection, reporting and impartial verification of statistics on the quantities and hazardousness of products placed on the Member States market, and the application of the quaternary treatment to urban wastewater in an efficient manner. Those contributions should also cover operational costs of already established quaternary treatment at the date of entry into force of this Directive when it is necessary to meet the obligations of the extended producer responsibility system. It should also cover part of the investment costs of the established quaternary treatments, taking into account the depreciation of the investments and the deadlines of the financing obligations established in this Directive. Since urban wastewater is treated collectively, it is appropriate to introduce a requirement for producers to join a centralised organisation which can implement their obligations under the extended producer responsibility on their behalf.\n\n(24)\n\n\t\n\nThe evaluation has also shown that the urban wastewater treatment sector offers the opportunity to significantly reduce its own energy consumption and to produce renewable energy, for example by better use of the available surfaces in urban wastewater treatment plants for solar energy production or by producing biogas from sludge as well as by heat or kinetic energy or other renewable energy sources. The evaluation also illustrated that, without clear legal obligations, only partial progress can be expected in that sector. In this context, Member States should be required to ensure that the total annual energy used by all urban wastewater treatment plants on their territory treating a load of 10 000 p.e. and above does not exceed the production of energy from renewable sources as defined in Article 2(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), by those urban wastewater treatment plants. In order to take into account the specificities of each urban wastewater treatment plant, optimise the investments needed and provide for the required flexibility to reach the energy neutrality objective, while ensuring that the potential for renewable energy production and for energy savings is fully achieved, that objective should be met at national level and not for each treatment plant. All renewable energies produced by the urban wastewater treatment plants operators or their owners, whether on-site or off-site, such as hydraulic, solar, thermal, wind energy or biogas, should be taken into account. That objective should be progressively met with interim targets by 31 December 2045. It should be possible to purchase a limited amount of non-fossil energy, not directly linked to urban wastewater treatment activities, from external sources in 2040 and 2045, through the use of a derogation linked to conditions. Renewable energy generated by or on behalf of the owners or operators of the urban wastewater treatment plant should not comprise purchased renewable energy. Reaching that energy neutrality objective will contribute in particular to reducing the avoidable GHG emissions from the urban wastewater treatment sector, while supporting the achievement of the 2050 climate neutrality objectives and related national and Union objectives, such as the objectives set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). However, initiatives to achieve energy neutrality should not lead to an increase in emissions of methane or nitrous oxide. In line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Member States should facilitate permit granting procedures for renewable energy projects required to reach energy neutrality of the urban wastewater treatment sector. Encouraging EU-based biogas or solar energy production while enhancing energy efficiency measures in line with the Energy Efficiency First principle defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and making an optimal use of digitalisation, which means taking utmost account of cost-efficient energy efficiency measures in shaping energy policy and making relevant investment decisions, will also help reduce the Union’s energy dependence, one of the objectives expressed in the communication from the Commission of 18 May 2022 entitled ‘REPower EU Plan’. It is also in line with Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) and with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 in which urban wastewater treatment sites are identified as ‘go-to’ areas for renewables, meaning a location designated as particularly suitable for the installation of plants for the production of energy from renewable sources. In order to reach the objective of energy neutrality via optimal measures for each urban wastewater treatment plant and for the collection system, Member States should ensure that energy audits, as defined in Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), are carried out every four years. Those audits should also include an identification of the potential for reduction of energy consumption, cost-effective recovery and use of waste heat, either on-site or via a district energy system, or cost-effective use or production of renewable energy following the criteria set out in Annex VI to Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (17).\n\n(25)\n\n\t\n\nSince methane emission reductions have a greater impact on climate change mitigation than carbon dioxide emission reductions proportionately, and due to the urban wastewater treatment sector being identified as one of the main emitting sectors for methane emissions, that sector should monitor and aim to reduce methane emissions as outlined in the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26), similar to the Methane Emissions Reduction in Regulation (EU) 2024/1787 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), in order to ensure the urban wastewater treatment sector’s contribution to the achievement of the climate neutrality target by 2050 at the latest, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119.\n\n(26)\n\n\t\n\nSince the transboundary nature of water pollution requires cooperation between neighbouring Member States or third countries in addressing such pollution and identifying measures to tackle its source, Member States should be required to inform each other or the third country concerned if significant water pollution originating from urban wastewater discharges in one Member State or third country impacts or is likely to impact the water quality of another Member State or third country. Such information should be provided immediately in cases of incidental pollution significantly affecting downstream water bodies, and responses should be communicated in a timely manner. Where Member States have concluded previous agreements between them or with third countries on environmental water issues, cooperation through those agreements could be taken into account. The Commission should be informed of such pollution and, if necessary, participate in meetings at the request of Member States. It is also important to tackle the transboundary pollution from third countries sharing the same water bodies with some of the Member States. For the purpose of dealing with pollution coming from or arriving in third countries, the cooperation and coordination with third countries may be carried out in the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (19) or other relevant regional Conventions such as the Regional Seas or Rivers Conventions.\n\n(27)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the protection of the environment and human health, Member States should ensure that the collecting systems and urban wastewater treatment plants built to comply with the requirements of this Directive are designed, constructed, operated and maintained to ensure sufficient performance under all normal local climatic conditions. As urban wastewater infrastructure has been recognised as critical entities under Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), Member States should also ensure that urban wastewater treatment plants and collecting systems are assessed as regards their vulnerability to extreme events occurring due to climate change, when they are being designed, constructed and operated.\n\n(28)\n\n\t\n\nUrban wastewater treatment plants also receive non-domestic wastewater, including industrial wastewater, which can contain a range of pollutants not explicitly covered by Directive 91/271/EEC, such as heavy metals, microplastics, micropollutants and other chemicals, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Such non-domestic wastewater may come, for example, from industries, commercial establishments, or hospitals and other medical facilities. In most instances, there is a poor understanding and poor knowledge of such pollution, which can lead to a deterioration in the functioning of the treatment process and contribute to the pollution of the receiving waters, while also preventing the recovery of sludge and the reuse of treated wastewater. Member States should therefore regularly monitor and report on such non-domestic pollution that enters urban wastewater treatment plants and is discharged into water bodies. To prevent pollution from non-domestic wastewater discharges at source, releases from industries or enterprises connected to collecting systems should be subject to prior regulations or specific authorisation, or both, by the competent authority or appropriate body. In order to ensure that collecting systems and urban wastewater treatment plants are technically capable of receiving and treating the incoming pollution, the operators who manage urban wastewater treatment plants receiving non-domestic wastewater should be consulted and informed before those authorisations are issued or those prior regulations are adopted, and should be able to consult, on request, the issued authorisations in order to be able to adapt their treatment processes. Where non-domestic pollution is identified in the incoming waters, Member States should take appropriate measures to reduce pollution at source, by enhancing the monitoring of pollutants in collecting systems so that the pollution sources can be identified and, where necessary, by reviewing the authorisations provided to relevant, connected urban wastewater treatment plants.\n\n(29)\n\n\t\n\nThe water resources of the Union are increasingly under pressure, resulting in permanent or temporary water scarcity in some areas of the Union. The Union’s ability to respond to the increasing pressures on water resources could be improved through a wider reuse of treated urban wastewater, limiting freshwater abstraction from surface and groundwater bodies. Therefore, the reuse of treated urban wastewater should be encouraged and applied whenever appropriate, especially in water-stressed areas, and for all appropriate purposes, while ensuring the minimum ecological flow of the receiving waters and taking into account the need to ensure that the objectives of good ecological and chemical status of the receiving bodies, as defined in Directive 2000/60/EC, are met. To achieve this, Member States should carry out monitoring of the impact of the reuse of treated urban wastewater on the minimum ecological flow of receiving waters in their assessment of impacts carried out under Directive 2000/60/EC. The potential for the reuse of treated urban wastewater should be assessed while taking into account the river basin management plans established under Directive 2000/60/EC and Member States’ decisions under Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/741 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), as well as the need to ensure that the objectives of good ecological and chemical status of the receiving bodies, as defined in Directive 2000/60/EC, are met. The reinforcement of the requirements for the treatment of urban wastewater, and the actions to better monitor, track and reduce pollution at source, will have impacts on the quality of treated urban wastewater, and will therefore support water reuse. Where water reuse serves the purpose of agricultural irrigation, it should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/741. Where appropriate to ensure the safe reuse of treated urban wastewater, Member States should consider quaternary treatment for the urban wastewater that is reused or will be reused. Measures on promoting the reuse of treated urban wastewater and on such reuse itself should be considered in strategies on water resilience at Member State level, when such strategies are available.\n\n(30)\n\n\t\n\nThe nutrients contained in urban wastewater can be useful in cases where treated urban wastewater is reused in agriculture in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/741. In those cases, Member States should be able to benefit, under specific conditions which ensure the highest level of protection of the environment and human health, from a derogation from the obligation to apply tertiary treatment in accordance with this Directive only for the part of the treated urban wastewater that is reused in agriculture.\n\n(31)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the proper implementation of this Directive and in particular respect for the emission limit values, it is important to monitor discharges of treated urban wastewater into the environment. The monitoring should be done through the establishment at national level of a mandatory system for prior regulations or specific authorisations, or both, in order to discharge the treated urban wastewater into the environment. In addition, in order to prevent unintentional discharges of biomedia into the environment from urban wastewater treatment plants using biomedia, it is essential to include in the discharge authorisations or regulations, or both, specific obligations to continuously monitor and prevent such discharges. Such biomedia are usually made of plastic and might include, inter alia, biocarriers, biobeads or polystyrene beads.\n\n(32)\n\n\t\n\nWhere necessary, Member States should adapt their urban wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure according to the size of their population and to the associated load of domestic wastewater in order to remain compliant with the requirements of this Directive. The possible impact of discharges on water bodies resulting from the construction and adaptation of such infrastructure should not be considered to be a breach of their obligations under Directive 2000/60/EC provided that all the conditions laid down under this Directive are fulfilled.\n\n(33)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the protection of the environment, direct discharges of biodegradable non-domestic wastewater into the environment from certain industrial sectors should be subject to appropriate requirements. Those requirements should ensure that direct discharges from certain industrial sectors are subject to secondary, tertiary and quaternary treatment as necessary for the protection of the environment and human health, and that, upon final analysis, the parameters set for treated wastewater are respected or the same level of environmental protection is ensured.\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\nAccording to Article 168(1) TFEU, Union action complements national policies and is to be directed towards improving public health and preventing diseases. In order to ensure optimal use of relevant public health data from urban wastewater, urban wastewater surveillance should be set up and used for preventive or early warning purposes, for instance in the detection of specific viruses in urban wastewater as a signal of the emergence of epidemics or pandemics. Member States should establish a dialogue and coordination between competent authorities responsible for public health and competent authorities responsible for urban wastewater management. In the context of that coordination, roles, responsibilities and costs should be clearly allocated among those competent authorities. Member States should develop a list of parameters relevant for public health to be monitored in urban wastewater as well as the frequency and location of the sampling, taking into account the recommendations of, among others, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), of the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and of the World Health Organization (WHO) and consider the following health parameters for inclusion in such a list: SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, poliovirus, influenza virus, emerging pathogens and any other public health parameters that may be considered relevant. On the basis of information gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic and experience gained from the implementation of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/472 (22), Member States should be required to monitor relevant health parameters in urban wastewater in the event of a health emergency. In order to ensure that harmonised methods are used, Member States should, to the extent possible, use the sampling and analysis methods set out in Recommendation (EU) 2021/472 for the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.\n\n(35)\n\n\t\n\nThe Union recognises the importance of tackling the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in particular in the Communication from the Commission of 29 June 2017 entitled ‘A European One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)’, and adopted the European One Health Action Plan against AMR. According to the WHO, urban wastewater is recognised and documented as a major source of antimicrobial agents and their metabolites, as well as antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and their genes. In order to increase the knowledge on the main sources of AMR, a monitoring obligation for the presence of AMR in urban wastewater should be introduced to further develop our scientific knowledge and potentially take adequate action in the future.\n\n(36)\n\n\t\n\nThis Directive acknowledges the ‘One Health’ approach, as recognised by the WHO, to be an integrated and unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimise the health of people, animals and ecosystems. The ‘One Health’ approach recognises that the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the wider environment, including ecosystems, are closely interlinked and interdependent.\n\n(37)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to protect the environment and human health, Member States should identify and assess the risks caused by urban wastewater management. The risk assessment could include a broad chemical screening, including chemical mixtures, or biological effect-based methods, or both, in order to identify substances that cause concern for, inter alia, aquatic life or the quality of drinking or bathing water. On the basis of that identification, and where necessary to comply with the requirements of the Union water legislation, Member States should take measures for the collection and treatment of urban wastewater that are more stringent than the measures required to comply with the minimum requirements set out in this Directive. In line with Article 191(2) TFEU and in addition to the measures provided for or taken in accordance with Article 11(3) of Directive 2000/60/EC, Member States should promote, as a priority, the control of pollutants at source to prevent the pollution of receiving water bodies. In particular, Member States should take preventive measures to limit the risk that intentionally and unintentionally released microplastics reach urban wastewater and sludge.\n\n(38)\n\n\t\n\nDepending on the situation, those more stringent measures can include, inter alia, the establishment of collecting systems, the development of integrated urban wastewater management plans or the application of secondary, tertiary or quaternary treatment to urban wastewater for agglomerations or urban wastewater treatment plants that do not reach the p.e. thresholds triggering the application of the standard requirements. They can also include treatment that is more advanced than the treatment necessary to respect the minimum requirements or disinfection of treated urban wastewater necessary to comply with Directive 2006/7/EC.\n\n(39)\n\n\t\n\nTarget 6.2 of UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 on clean water and sanitation requires Member States, by 2030, to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. Sanitation facilities should allow the safe management and disposal of human urine, faeces and menstrual blood and the changing of menstrual products. Furthermore, Principle 20 of the European Pillar of Social Rights states that everyone has the right to access essential services of good quality, including water and sanitation. Against that background, and in accordance with the recommendations in the WHO Guidelines for Sanitation and Health (23) and the Protocol on Water and Health to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, done in London on 17 June 1999, Member States should tackle the issue of access to sanitation at national level. That should be done through actions ensuring access to sanitation for all, for example by setting up sanitation facilities in public spaces, as well as by encouraging the availability of appropriate sanitation facilities in public administrations and public buildings free of charge or making them affordable to all, including all kinds of facilities and services, such as flush and dry toilets. They should be safely managed, which means that they should be accessible to all, where appropriate, at all times, including for people with particular needs, such as children, older persons, persons with disabilities and homeless people, that they should be placed in a location that ensures maximum safety for users, and that they should be hygienically and technically safe to use. Such facilities should also be sufficient in number to ensure that the needs of people are met and waiting times are not unreasonably long. The sufficient number of sanitation facilities in public spaces should be decided at the appropriate level, taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.\n\n(40)\n\n\t\n\nThe specific situation of minority cultures, such as Roma and Travellers, whether settled or not, and in particular their lack of access to sanitation, was acknowledged in the Communication from the Commission of 7 October 2020 entitled ‘A Union of Equality: EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation’, which calls for increasing effective equal access to essential services. Overall, it is appropriate that Member States pay particular attention to vulnerable groups or groups that are marginalised due to factors related to their socio-economic situation, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, disability, homelessness, legal status, religious conviction or other reasons by taking the measures necessary to ensure access to sanitation for those groups. It is important that the identification of those groups be consistent with Article 16(1) of Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24). Measures to improve access to sanitation by vulnerable and marginalised groups might include providing sanitation facilities in public and private spaces for free or for a low service fee as well as in public administration buildings, improving or maintaining the connection to adequate systems to collect urban wastewater, and raising awareness of the nearest sanitation facilities.\n\n(41)\n\n\t\n\nAccording to the EU Human Rights Guidelines on Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation, adopted by the Council on 17 June 2019, particular attention has to be given to the needs of women and girls, as they are particularly at risk and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes. This is in line with the Council Conclusions on Water Diplomacy, adopted on 19 November 2018, which reaffirm the importance of integrating a gender perspective into water diplomacy. Therefore, Member States should pay particular attention to women and girls as being a vulnerable group and should take the measures necessary to improve or maintain safe access to sanitation for them.\n\n(42)\n\n\t\n\nThe evaluation concluded that sludge management could be improved to better align it with the principles of the circular economy and of the waste hierarchy as defined in Article 4 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (25). The actions to better monitor and reduce pollution at source from non-domestic discharges will contribute to improving the quality of the sludge produced and ensure its safe use in agriculture. In order to ensure the proper and safe recovery of nutrients, including the critical substance phosphorus, from sludge, a minimum combined reuse and recycling rate should be set at Union level. Member States should be able to choose whether to reuse or recycle, or both, urban wastewater or sludge, or both, in order to recover phosphorus. The combined minimum reuse and recycling rate should take into account the phosphorus content of sludge, which can vary from one area to another. It should also take into account the level of saturation of each national market, for example the availability of other sources of phosphorus from organic sources, for instance from livestock farming, and the possibilities of its absorption in agriculture. Member States should be encouraged to monitor micropollutants in sludge, particularly where there is a risk of accumulation of micropollutants in sludge, and when it is reused in agriculture in order to increase knowledge about its presence and to protect the environment and human health. The proper and safe recovery of nutrients and their reuse in agriculture should be encouraged in order to support the resilience and sustainability of the agricultural sector and contribute to the strategic autonomy of the Union fertiliser industry. In that context, Member States should, while taking into account national and local valorisation options, take measures to encourage the production and purchasing of recovered nutrients from urban wastewater and sludge. When reusing sludge in agriculture particular attention should be paid to microplastics. Microplastics should therefore be systematically monitored when sludge is reused in agriculture. This information is indispensable for the safe management of sludge in agriculture and any possible review of relevant Union policy.\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nAdequate monitoring is necessary to verify compliance with the new requirements of this Directive concerning micropollutants, non-domestic pollution, energy neutrality, storm water overflows and urban runoff. Monitoring should be supported, where technically feasible and appropriate, through the use of digital tools. In particular for the operational management of collecting systems and urban wastewater treatment plants, the use of digital tools should be systematically considered. To verify the compliance of the quaternary treatment concerning the reduction of micropollutants in urban wastewater discharges, it is sufficient to monitor a limited set of representative micropollutants. The monitoring frequencies should be built on the current best practices, as currently practised in Switzerland. To remain cost-effective, those obligations should be adapted to the size of the urban wastewater treatment plants and of the agglomerations. For the purposes of such monitoring, this Directive provides for sampling to be carried out. Each time sampling is carried out, a sample is taken both at the inlet and outlet of the urban wastewater treatment plant. The monitoring will also contribute to providing data for the overall Environmental Monitoring Framework as set up under the 8th Environmental Action Programme (26), and more specifically to feeding the Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook Framework underpinning it, set out in the Commission Communication of 12 May 2021 entitled ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All EU Action Plan: “Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil”’.\n\n(44)\n\n\t\n\nMicroplastics and relevant micropollutants should be monitored, where relevant, in storm water overflow discharges and in discharges of urban runoff from separate systems with a representative sampling programme allowing for concentration estimation with a view to modelling water quality. GHG emissions should be monitored by means of analysis, calculations or modelling, where appropriate.\n\n(45)\n\n\t\n\nTo ensure the protection of the environment and that adequate action is taken under any risk assessment to be carried out for the implementation of this Directive as well as for the implementation of other Union law, Member States should monitor a broad spectrum of pollutants at the inlets and outlets of the urban wastewater treatment plants. To avoid an unnecessary burden, only pollutants that can be expected to be found in urban wastewater should be monitored, taking into account the high variety of pollutants which could reach urban wastewater treatment plants, including from non-domestic wastewater sources. Member States should be able to reduce the monitoring frequency if pollutants are not found in subsequent sampling campaigns. More specifically, recent data shows that PFAS are found in urban wastewater, sometimes at high concentrations. The most recent scientific evidence shows that PFAS are a concern for the environment and for public health due to their persistence. It is therefore essential to better understand the pathways of PFAS into the environment and to monitor them in the inlet and outlet of the urban wastewater treatment plants. This monitoring should start in the first instance where the discharges reach catchment areas used for the abstraction of drinking water, due to the high risks of being exposed to PFAS and their impact on health.\n\n(46)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden and better use the possibilities offered by digitalisation, the reporting on the implementation of this Directive should be improved and simplified by removing the obligation for Member States to report every two years to the Commission and for the Commission to publish bi-yearly reports. It should be replaced by a requirement for Member States to improve, with the support of the EEA, the existing national standardised data sets established under Directive 91/271/EEC, and to regularly update them. The Commission will use those improved data sets to verify compliance with this Directive. It is appropriate for the reporting model to be developed by the EEA in collaboration with Member States. Access to the national databases should be provided to the Commission and the EEA. In order to ensure complete information on the application of this Directive, the data sets should include information on compliance of urban wastewater treatment plants with the treatment requirements (pass/fail, loads and concentration of pollutants discharged), on the level of achievement of the objectives of energy neutrality, on GHG emissions of the treatment plants above 10 000 p.e. and on measures taken by the Member States in the context of storm water overflows and urban runoff, access to sanitation and treatment by individual systems. Moreover, full consistency with Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27) should be ensured in order to optimise the use of the data, as well as to support full transparency. The information collected through those data sets should support a comparison of, and an exchange of best practices at Union level with regard to, the performance of urban wastewater treatment plants. The administrative burden of providing information and data to the public should at all times be such as to respect the principle of proportionality.\n\n(47)\n\n\t\n\nThe implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC is financed through water tariffs and public budgets, including Union funding. In the future, the extended producer responsibility should be such as to ensure that the costs of the quaternary treatment are at least partially borne by the industries concerned and complemented by other types of financing. In the past, the implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC was also substantially supported by the Union’s Cohesion Policy and programmes under Horizon 2020 and LIFE. In order to ensure the timely and proper implementation of this Directive, it is essential that Member States establish a national implementation programme including long-term programming of the required investments accompanied by a financing strategy. Those national implementation programmes should be reported to the Commission. To limit the administrative burden, that requirement should not apply to Member States in which more than 95 % of the agglomerations are compliant with the main obligations to treat and collect wastewater. To continue the implementation of this Directive, the Commission should consider the national implementation programmes reported by Member States for the preparation of the next multiannual financial framework and those following thereafter and the Member States should put in place the required extended producer responsibility system without delay.\n\n(48)\n\n\t\n\nThe urban wastewater collection and treatment sector is specific, operating as a captive market, with public and small enterprises being connected to the collecting system without being able to choose their operators. It is therefore important to ensure public access to operators’ key performance indicators, such as the level of treatment achieved, the costs of treatment, the energy used and produced, and the related GHG emissions and carbon footprint. In order to make the public more aware of the implications of urban wastewater treatment, key information on the annual wastewater collection and treatment costs for each household should be provided, at least in agglomerations above 10 000 p.e., and preferably above 1 000 p.e., in an easily accessible manner, for instance on the invoices, while other detailed information should be accessible in a user-friendly format online, on a website of the operator or the competent authority.\n\n(49)\n\n\t\n\nDirective 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (28) guarantees the right of access to environmental information in the Member States in line with the 1998 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the ‘Aarhus Convention’) (29). The Aarhus Convention encompasses broad obligations related both to making environmental information available upon request and actively disseminating such information. It is important that the provisions of this Directive related to access to information and data-sharing arrangements complement that Directive, by establishing the obligation to make available to the public online information on the collection and treatment of urban wastewater in a user-friendly manner, without creating a separate legal regime.\n\n(50)\n\n\t\n\nThe effectiveness of this Directive and its aim of protecting public health in the context of the Union’s environment policy require that natural or legal persons, or where appropriate their duly constituted organisations, be able to rely on it in legal proceedings and that the national courts be able to take this Directive into consideration as an element of Union law in order, inter alia, to review decisions of a national authority where appropriate. In addition, according to settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, under the principle of sincere cooperation laid down in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), it is for the courts of the Member States to ensure judicial protection of a person’s rights under Union law. Furthermore, Article 19(1) TEU requires Member States to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law. This should be done in accordance with national rules, without depriving the provision on compensation of its effectiveness. In addition, in accordance with the Aarhus Convention, members of the public concerned are to have access to justice in order to contribute to the protection of the right to live in an environment which is adequate for personal health and well-being.\n\n(51)\n\n\t\n\nTo adapt this Directive to scientific and technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending certain parts of the Annexes with regard to the adaptation of monitoring to state-of-the-art methods for monitoring, including with a view to making optimal use of digital tools and taking into account the relevant methods used in other relevant Union law, and evaluation of results for the requirements for the tertiary and quaternary treatment, and the requirements for prior regulations and specific authorisations for discharges of non-domestic wastewater into collecting systems and urban wastewater treatment plants and in respect of supplementing this Directive by specifying a minimum combined reuse and recycling rate for phosphorus from sludge and from urban wastewater, taking into account available technologies and resources as well as the economic viability for phosphorus recovery and by updating the information provided to the public online and to households. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (30). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(52)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission for the adoption of standards for the design of individual systems, for the establishment of the format of the reporting and the level of detail of the information in relation to individual systems, for establishing the format and the method of the risk assessment to be used in the context of the quaternary treatment, for the adoption of monitoring and assessment methods for the indicators of the quaternary treatment and the objectives regarding energy neutrality, for the establishment of common conditions and criteria for the application of the exemption for certain products from extended producer responsibility, for establishing methodologies for supporting the development of integrated urban wastewater management plans, for the development of alternative indicators to the load-based indicative objective of pollution reduction based for instance on volume, number of occurrences of storm water overflows, volume of the discharged urban runoff, or other relevant alternative indicators, and for establishing a minimum frequency of sampling and methodologies for measuring antimicrobial resistance, direct and indirect GHG emissions and microplastics in urban wastewater and sludge, for the establishment of a minimum list of relevant pollutants likely to be found in urban wastewater including a methodology for identifying relevant pollutants likely to be found in urban wastewater and criteria for revising the exclusion of some pollutants to be monitored, for the establishment of a harmonised methodology for measuring ‘Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Total’ and ‘Sum of PFAS’ in urban wastewater and for the adoption of the format of, and modalities for presenting, the information to be provided by Member States and compiled by the EEA on the implementation of this Directive. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (31).\n\n(53)\n\n\t\n\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, and should, as applicable, take into account the financial situation of the natural or legal person held responsible.\n\n(54)\n\n\t\n\nPursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, the Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Directive within a certain period of time from the date set for its transposition. That evaluation should be based on experience gained and data collected during the implementation of this Directive, on any available WHO recommendations, and on relevant scientific, analytical, and epidemiological data. In the evaluation, particular attention should be given to an analysis of the adequacy of the public health parameters used in urban wastewater surveillance, an analysis of the added value of a mandatory monitoring of public health parameters, an analysis of the possible necessity to adapt the list of products to be covered by extended producer responsibility systems including the conditions for exemptions, an analysis of the possible impacts on the functioning of the internal market of the potentially different contribution rates for producers set by Member States, an analysis of the feasibility and appropriateness of the development of an extended producer responsibility system for products generating PFAS and microplastics, an analysis of the added value and the appropriateness of requiring mandatory national water reuse plans including national targets and measures, an evaluation of the objective of energy neutrality in order to analyse the technical and economic feasibility and environmental and climate benefits to achieve a higher level of energy autonomy in the sector, an evaluation of the possibilities for measuring direct and indirect GHG emissions emitted from the urban wastewater sector, an evaluation of the possibility of reaching climate neutrality for the urban wastewater treatment sector, and the time required to do so, as well as the feasibility and appropriateness of setting Union minimum reuse and recycling rates for nitrogen from sludge or from urban wastewater, or both.\n\n(55)\n\n\t\n\nDirective 91/271/EEC provides for specific deadlines for Mayotte due to its inclusion in 2014 as an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 TFEU. Therefore, the application of the obligations to establish collecting systems and apply secondary treatment to urban wastewater from agglomerations of 2 000 p.e. and above should be deferred with respect to Mayotte.\n\n(56)\n\n\t\n\nIt is appropriate to consider the specific situation of Mayotte and the Union’s other outermost regions, as listed in Article 349 TFEU, which provides for specific measures to support those regions. In terms of urban wastewater treatment of those territories, special attention should be given to the difficult topography and insularity of those territories.\n\n(57)\n\n\t\n\nIn order to ensure the continuity of the protection of the environment, it is important that Member States maintain at least the current level of tertiary treatment until the new requirements for the reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen become applicable. Therefore, Article 5 of Directive 91/271/EEC should continue to apply until those new requirements become applicable.\n\n(58)\n\n\t\n\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to protect the environment and public health, to make progress in achieving climate neutrality for urban wastewater collection and treatment activities, to improve access to sanitation and to ensure the regular surveillance of parameters relevant to public health, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n(59)\n\n\t\n\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to Directive 91/271/EEC. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under that Directive.\n\n(60)\n\n\t\n\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for the transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex VII,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\nArticle 1\n\nSubject matter\n\nThis Directive lays down rules on the collection, treatment and discharge of urban wastewater, to protect the environment and human health, in line with the One Health approach, while progressively reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to sustainable levels, improving the energy balance of urban wastewater collection and treatment activities and contributing to the transition towards a circular economy. It also lays down rules on access to sanitation for all, on transparency of the urban wastewater sector, on the regular surveillance of relevant public health parameters in urban wastewater and on the implementation of the polluter-pays principle.\n\nArticle 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply:\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\n‘urban wastewater’ means any of the
